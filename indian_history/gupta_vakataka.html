              <ul>
                <li>
                  The fall of Kushana empire towards the middle of 3rd century
                  AD led to the establishment of the empire of the Guptas.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Although the Gupta empire was not as large as the Mauryas, it
                  kept North India politically united for more than a century.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Their period is generally regarded as the
                  <b>Golden Age of India.</b>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>Sri Gupta</b> was the founder of Gupta dynasty. Sri Gupta
                  was followed by his son <b>Ghatotkacha</b> who was followed by
                  his son <b>Chandragupta I</b> .
                </li>
                <li>
                  In the Allahabad Pillar inscription, Sri Gupta and his son
                  Ghatotkacha are described as Maharaja ("great king"), while
                  Chandragupta I is called a Maharajadhiraja ("king of great
                  kings").
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h2>Gupta Dynasty</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <h3>Chandragupta – I (319–335/336 AD)</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  First important king of the Gupta Dynasty; laid the
                  foundations of the Gupta empire and claimed the title of
                  <b>maharajadhiraja</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He started <b>Gupta era</b> in <b>319−20 CE</b>, which
                  presumably marks his accession date. His empire included parts
                  of modern Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Bengal; with its capital at
                  <b>Pataliputra</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He enhanced his power and prestige by marrying
                  <b>Kumaradevi</b>, princess of Lichchhavi clan of Nepal and
                  issued Chandragupta I-Kumaradevi type gold coins.
                  <b>Samudragupta</b> was referred to as
                  <b>Lichchhavi-dauhitra</b> (grandson of the Lichchhavis) in
                  the famous
                  <b>Allahabad prashasti.</b>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Samudragupta (335/336–375 AD)</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Son and successor of Chandragupta I. He was a great conqueror
                </li>
                <li>
                  The long inscription in the
                  <b>pillar of Allahabad (Prayag Prasasti) </b> enumerated by
                  his court poet <b>Harisena</b> informs about the people and
                  the countries that were conquered by Samudragupta. Because of
                  his bravery and generalship, he came to be called the
                  <b>Napoleon of India</b> by VA Smith.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Samudragupta’s arms reached as far as Kanchi, Tamil Nadu,
                  where the Pallavas were compelled to recognise his suzerainty.
                  <b>Virasen</b> was his Commander-in-Chief during Southern
                  campaign. His authority over Java, Sumatra and Malaya island
                  proves that he maintained a strong navy.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Samudragupta is said to have composed numerous poems of high
                  merit. Some of his coins represent him playing the Veena. He
                  also performed Ashvamedha sacrifices.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Allahabad pillar inscriptions mention the title
                  <b>Dharma Prachar Bandhu</b> i.e. he was the upholder of
                  Brahmanical religion.
                </li>
                <li>
                  According to Chinese sources, <b>Meghavarman</b>, the ruler of
                  Sri Lanka, sent a missionary to Samudragupta for a permission
                  to build a Buddhist temple at Gaya.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Chandragupta II (c. 376 – 413/15 CE )</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  According to <b>Devi Chandraguptam</b> of
                  <b>Vishakhadutta</b>, Samudragupta was succeeded by
                  <b>Ramagupta</b>. Ramagupta was a coward. He surrendered his
                  queen <b>Dhruvadevi</b> to the Shaka invader.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Chandragupta II, the younger brother of Ramagupta, invaded the

                  II defeated him which ended the rule of the Shakas on the
                  Indian subcontinent. This brought Malwa and its Chief city

                  with the mildness of administration. The Penal Code was mild
                  and offences were punished by fines only. From his accounts,

                  Hunas were a group of Central Asian tribes who, via the Khyber
                  Pass, entered the Indian Subcontinent at the end of the 5th or
                  early 6th century. They greatly weakened the Gupta Empire. The
                  Hunas were ultimately defeated by a coalition of Indian
                  princes that possibly included the Indian king Yasodharman of
                  Malwa, Narasimhagupta of the Gupta dynasty, and the Maukharis
                  (of Kannauj, UP). However, this victory over the Huns could
                  not revive the Gupta Empire.

                  Unlike the Mauryan period, Gupta administration was
                  <b>highly decentralized</b> and <b>quasi-feudal</b> in
                  character.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Gupta Kings adopted pompous titles such as

              <ul>
                <li>
                  The judicial system was far more developed under the Gupta
                  rulers than in earlier times. For the first time, civil and
                  criminal laws were clearly demarcated. Theft and adultery were
                  subjects treated under criminal law. Disputes regarding
                  various types of property formed the body of civil law.
                </li>
                <li>
                  There was the office of <b>mahanadanyaka</b> , who probably
                  functioned as chief justice. Uparikas and Vishyapatis in their
                  respective territorial jurisdiction dispensed the judicial
                  function.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Army</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The Gupta military organisation was also feudal by character
                  (though the emperor had a large standing army).
                </li>
                <li>
                  The commander in chief of the army was known as

                </li>
                <li>
                  Horse chariots receded into the background and cavalry came to
                  the forefront in this period.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Economy</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The Gupta period witnessed an increase in land taxes but a
                  decrease in trade and commerce taxes (such as tolls).
                </li>
                <li>
                  The king collected taxes varying from
                  <b>1/4th to 1/6th of the produce</b>. In addition to these
                  taxes, peasants were also subjected to <b>vishti</b> (forced
                  Labour) for serving the royal army and officials.
                </li>
                <li>
                  During the Gupta’s rule, land grants also included transfer of
                  royal rights over salt and mines, which were earlier state's
                  monopoly during Mauryas.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Gupta and post-Gupta period witnessed a comparative
                  decline in the country’s trade and commerce. The disruption of
                  the north-western trade route by the Huns was an attributed
                  factor for this decline.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Guptas issued a large number of gold coins called

                  Kushanas.

                  Varna system got strengthened due to the large-scale
                  proliferation of castes, chiefly because of assimilation of
                  foreigners into the Indian society,. The brahmana supremacy
                  continued.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The social and economic status of shudras improved during this

                  Mahabharata, and the Puranas.

                <li>
                  Gupta kings followed a policy of tolerance towards the

                  The Gupta period is considered as the Golden Age of art and
                  literature in ancient India. The literature in this period was

                  Synopsis of Abhijyanashakuntalam
                </h4>

                <p>
                  Sakuntala is the daughter of the sage Visvamitra and the
                  apsara Menaka. Abandoned at birth by her parents, Sakuntala
                  grows up in the secluded hermitage of the sage Kanva.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While Kanva and the other elders of the hermitage are away on
                  a pilgrimage, Dusyanta, king of Hastinapur, comes hunting in
                  the forest. He spots Sakuntala. Captivated by her, he marries
                  her. Soon, he has to leave to take care of affairs in the
                  capital. She is given a ring by the king, which will
                  eventually have to be presented to him when she appears in his
                  court to claim her place as queen.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One day, the anger-prone sage Durvasas arrives when Sakuntala
                  is lost in her thoughts, and when she fails to attend to him,
                  he curses her by bewitching Dusyanta into forgetting her
                  existence. The only cure is for Sakuntala to show the king the
                  signet ring that he gave her. She later travels to meet him,
                  and has to cross a river. The ring is lost when it slips off
                  her hand as she dips it in the water playfully.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On arrival the king is unable to recognize the person he
                  married and therefore refuses to acknowledge her. Fortunately,
                  the ring is discovered by a fisherman in the belly of a fish,
                  and presents it in the king's court. Dusyanta realizes his
                  mistake - too late. The newly wise Dusyanta is asked to defeat
                  an army of Asuras, and is rewarded by Indra with a journey
                  through heaven.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After returning to Earth years later, Dusyanta finds young
                  Bharata playing with lion cubs and enquires about his parents,
                  and finds out that Bharata is indeed his son. Bharata is an
                  ancestor of the lineages of the Kauravas and Pandavas, who
                  fought the epic war of the Mahabharata. It is after this
                  Bharata that India was given the name "Bharatavarsha", the
                  'Land of Bharata'.

                  In peninsular India, especially in northern Maharashtra and

                  succeeded by a local power known as the Vakatakas, who played
                  an effective role in the political game of the Deccan for more
                  than two and a half centuries.
