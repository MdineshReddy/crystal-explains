              <h2>Emergence of Gandhi</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>

              <h3>Early Career</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was born on
                  <b>October 2, 1869</b> in Porbandar in the princely state of
                  Kathiawar in Gujarat.
                </li>
                <li>
                  His father was a diwan of the state. Having
                  <b>studied law in England</b>, Gandhi, in 1898,
                  <b>went to South Africa</b> in connection with a case
                  involving his client, <b>Dada Abdullah.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  In South Africa he witnessed the ugly face of white racism and
                  the humiliation and contempt to which Asians, who had gone to
                  South Africa as labourers, were subjected.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He decided to stay in South Africa to organise the Indian
                  workers to enable them to fight for their rights.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Satyagraha against Registration Certificates (1906)</b>
                </li>
                <ul style="list-style-type: square">
                  <li>
                    A new legislation in South Africa made it compulsory for
                    Indians there to carry at all times certificates of
                    registration with their fingerprints.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Gandhi formed the Passive Resistance Association to conduct
                    the campaign of defying the law and suffering all the
                    penalties resulting from such a defiance.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Thus was born <b>satyagraha or devotion to truth</b>, the
                    technique of resisting adversaries without violence.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    For Gandhi, Satyagraha was different from "passive
                    resistance", by then a familiar technique of social protest,
                    which he regarded as a practical strategy adopted by the
                    weak in the face of superior force; Satyagraha, on the other
                    hand, was for him the "last resort of those strong enough in
                    their commitment to truth to undergo suffering in its
                    cause".
                  </li>
                </ul>

                    Marriages
                  </b>
                </li>
                <ul style="list-style-type: square">
                  <li>
                    A poll tax of three pounds was imposed on all ex-indentured
                    Indians. The demand for the abolition of poll tax widened
                    the base of the campaign.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Then a Supreme Court order which invalidated all marriages
                    not conducted according to Christian rites and registered by
                    the registrar of marriages drew the anger of the Indians and
                    others who were not Christians. The Indians treated this
                    judgement as an insult to the honour of women and many women
                    were drawn into the movement because of this indignity.

                </ul>
                <li>

                    The Indians protested the Transvaal Immigration Act, by
                    illegally migrating from Natal into Transvaal.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The government held these Indians in jails. Miners and
                    plantation workers went on a lightning strike.

                  <li>
                    In India, Gokhale toured the whole country mobilising public

                  </li>
                </ul>
              </ul>
              <br />
              <p>
                <b>Compromise Solution</b>: Eventually, through a series of
                negotiations, an agreement was reached by which the Government
                of South Africa conceded the major Indian demands relating to
                the poll tax, the registration certificates and marriages

                During his time in South Africa, in his essay,
                <b>Hind Swaraj</b> , (1909), Gandhi formulated his vision of
                Swaraj, or "self-rule" for India based on three vital
                ingredients:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  solidarity between Indians of different faiths, but most of
                  all between Hindus and Muslims;
                </li>
                <li>the removal of untouchability from Indian society; and</li>
                <li>
                  the exercise of swadeshi—the boycott of manufactured foreign
                  goods and the revival of Indian cottage industry.

                <li>Gandhi returned to India in January <b>1915</b>.</li>
                <li>
                  His efforts in South Africa were well known not only among the
                  educated but also among the masses.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Gandhi followed the advice of his mentor
                  <b> Gopal Krishna Gokhale</b>
                  and chose not to make any public pronouncements during the
                  first year of his return, but instead spent the year
                  travelling, observing the country at first hand, and writing.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Gandhi made his political debut in India in 1917 in Champaran
                  district in Bihar, near the Nepal border.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Gandhi was requested to look into the problems of the farmers
                  in context of
                  <b>indigo planters</b> of Champaran.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The European planters had been forcing the peasants to grow
                  indigo on
                  <b>3/20 part of the total land</b> (called tinkathia system) .
                  When towards the end of the nineteenth century German
                  synthetic dyes replaced indigo, the European planters demanded
                  high rents and illegal dues from the peasants in order to
                  maximise their profits before the peasants could shift to
                  other crops.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Upon his arrival in the district, Gandhi was joined by other
                  agitators, including a young Congress leader,
                  <b>Rajendra Prasad</b>, from Bihar, who would become a loyal
                  supporter of Gandhi and go on to play a prominent role in the
                  Indian independence movement. .
                </li>
                <li>
                  Through Satyagraha, Gandhi was able to convince the
                  authorities that the tinkathia system should be abolished and
                  that the peasants should be compensated for the illegal dues
                  extracted from them. As a compromise with the planters, he
                  agreed that only 25 per cent of the money taken should be
                  compensated.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Within a decade, the planters left the area. Gandhi had won
                  the first battle of civil disobedience in India.

                To settle disputes between the mill owners of Ahmedabad and the
                workers who were distressed about their low wages, the
                satyagraha in Ahmedabad took the form of Gandhi fasting and
                supporting the workers in a strike, which eventually led to a
                settlement.

              <p>
                Due to failure of crops, the farmers, with Gandhi, withheld the
                revenue to get remission based on revenue code. The agitation in
                Kaira gained for Gandhi another lifelong lieutenant in
                <b>Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel</b> , who had organised the farmers,
                and who too would go on to play a leadership role in the Indian
                independence movement.

                Champaran, Kheda, and Ahmedabad were important milestones in the

                <li>
                  In <b>1919</b>, a Sedition Committee headed by
                  <b>Justice Rowlatt</b> led to the Rowlatt Act.
                </li>
                <li>
                  This act authorised the government to
                  <b
                    >imprison any person without trial and conviction by the

                </li>
                <li>
                  The law also enabled the government to suspend the right of
                  <b>Habeas Corpus</b> , which had been the foundation of Civil
                  Liberties in Britain.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It led to a countrywide agitation and marked the foundation of
                  Non-Cooperation Movement.
                </li>
                <li>
                  During March and April 1919, the country witnessed a
                  remarkable political awakening. There were hartals, strikes,

              <ul>
                <li>
                  The dissatisfaction against Rowlatt Act led to mass
                  agitations. A large but <b>unarmed crowd</b> had gathered on
                  <b>13th April, 1919</b> at <b>Amritsar (Punjab)</b> in the
                  Jallianwala Bagh, to protest against the arrest of their
                  popular leaders Dr Saifuddin Kitchlew and Dr Satyapal. Some
                  villagers gathered in the Bagh to celebrate the important

                  <b>General Reginald Dyer</b>, the
                  <b>Military Commander of Amritsar</b>, decided to terrorise
                  the people of Amritsar into complete submission. Jallianwala
                  Bagh was a large open space, which was enclosed on three sides
                  and had only one exit. General Dyer surrounded the Bagh,
                  closed the exit with his troops and then ordered his men to
                  shoot into the crowd. No warning was issued, no instruction to
                  disperse was given. An unarmed gathering of men, women and
                  children was fired upon as they tried to flee. Hundreds were
                  killed and thousands were wounded.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The entire nation was stunned.
                  <b>Rabindranath Tagore</b> renounced his knighthood in
                  protest. <b>Gandhi</b> gave up the title of Kaiser-i-Hind,
                  bestowed by the British for his work during the Boer War in
                  Africa.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Hunter Commission</b> was appointed to inquire into it.
                  Though the commitee unanimously condemned Dyer’s actions,it
                  did not impose any penal or disciplinary action. Dyer was
                  lauded for his actions by some in Britain. Eminent author
                  <b>Rudyard Kipling</b> (born in Bombay Presidency, wrote The
                  Jungle Book and White man's burden) called Dyer "the man who
                  saved India".

                <li>
                  Historians say though <b>General Dyer</b> was the man on the

                  After the war, the British removed the Khalifa from his power

                  of the HRA was the Kakori robbery. The men held up a train at
                  Kakori, an obscure village near Lucknow, and looted its
                  official railway cash. Government crackdown after the Kakori
                  robbery led to arrests of many, of whom 17 were jailed, four
                  transported for life and four were hanged.

                  The Government of India Act, 1919 (Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms)

                </li>
                <li>
                  An <b>all-white, seven-member</b> Indian Statutory Commission,
                  popularly known as the Simon Commission (after the name of its

                </li>
                <li>
                  The Indians protested, against the Simon Commission, because
                  of the exclusion of Indians from the Commission and in the
                  fear that the foreigners would discuss and decide upon India’s
                  fitness for self government.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The National Congress decided to boycott the commission in its

                <li>
                  The Commission’s arrival in India led to a powerful protest.
                  On 3rd February, 1928, the Commission was greeted with Hartals
                  and black flag demonstrations, under the slogan

              <h3>Nehru Report (1928)</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  All important Indian leaders and parties tried to meet the
                  challenge of the Simon Commission by getting together and
                  trying to evolve an alternative scheme of Constitutional
                  Reforms. Nehru report was tabled in
                  <b>1928 by Motilal Nehru.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  It remains memorable as the

                  and Fundamental Rights.
                </li>
                <li>
                  However, the recommendations evoked a debate concerning the
                  goal of
                  <b>India-Dominion status or Complete independence.</b>
                </li>

              <h3>Final- Nehru Report</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  It demanded responsible government both at the centre and in
                  the provinces. But, it <b>advocated dominion status</b>, not
                  complete independence.
                </li>
                <li>It demanded <b>Universal Suffrage</b>.</li>
                <li>
                  It demanded that there should be federal form of government
                  with residuary powers vested in the centre.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It <b>rejected separate communal electorate</b>. It proposed
                  Muslim reservation in the centre and provinces, where they
                  were in minority.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The report recommended equal rights for women, freedom to form
                  unions and disassociation of the state from religion in any
                  form.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It demanded for reorganisation of the North-West provinces on
                  lingustic basis.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>The Muslim and Hindu Communal Responses</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Muslim league demanded formation of three new Muslim majority
                  provinces— Sindh, Baluchistan and North-West Frontier Province
                  and that residuary powers go to the provinces.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Hindu Mahasabha was vehemently opposed to the proposals
                  for creating new Muslim-majority provinces and reservation of
                  seats for Muslims majorities in Punjab and Bengal (which would
                  ensure Muslim control over legislatures in both). It also
                  demanded a strictly unitary structure.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Nehru Report Found Unsatisfactory</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The report not only failed to satisfy the Muslim League, the
                  Hindu Mahasabha and the Sikh communalists unhappy but also the
                  younger section of the Congress led by Jawaharlal Nehru and
                  Subhash Chandra Bose were also angered.
                </li>
                <li>
                  All Parties strengthened their criticism of the dominion
                  status idea. Nehru and Subhash Chandra Bose rejected the
                  Congres's modified goal and jointly set up the
                  <b>Independence for India League</b> .

                  Congress adopted complete independence (<b>Poorna Swaraj</b>)
                  as its goal. Congress decided to launch a civil disobedience
                  movement. <b>January 26, 1930</b> was celebrated as the

                <li>
                  Before starting the Civil Disobedience Movement, Gandhiji
                  placed an
                  <b>Eleven point ultimatum</b> before <b>Irwin</b> (Viceroy)
                  for administrative reforms and stated that if Lord Irwin
                  accepted them, then there will be no agitation. Irwin ignored
                  it.

                  The Civil Disobedience Movement was started by Gandhi on 12th
                  March, 1930 with his famous Dandi March. Together with 78
                  chosen followers, Gandhi walked nearly 375 km
                  <b>from Sabarmati Ashram to Dandi</b> , a village on the
                  Gujarat sea-coast, where they made salt as a direct action
                  campaign of tax resistance and nonviolent protest against the
                  British salt monopoly.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Salt satyagraha spread to Tamil Nadu, Malabar, Andhra, Assam,
                  Bengal.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Salt production had geographical limitations. So, in other
                  parts of the country, the movement included– picketing of
                  liquor shops and auctions, no revenue campaign in Bardoli,
                  defiance of forest laws in Maharashtra, Karnataka and the
                  central provinces, refusal of chaukidari tax in Eastern India,
                  prabhat pheris-singing of National Songs.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The notable feature of the movement was a wide participation
                  of women.

                </li>
                <li>
                  Many Satyagrahis including Gandhiji and other Congress leaders

                <li>
                  Congress was declared illegal. Meanwhile, the British
                  Government summoned the <b>First Round Table Conference</b> in

                  On his return, Gandhiji resumed the Civil Disobedience
                  movement in 1932 and finally withdrew it in 1934. This period
                  is referred to as
                  <b>Second phase of Civil Disobedience Movement</b>.

              <h3>Poona Pact (Communal Award) (1932)</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  British prime minister, <b>Ramsay MacDonald</b> announced the
                  proposal on minority representation, known as the
                  <b>Communal Award</b> in 1932. Under this the depressed
                  classes (Muslims, Sikhs, Indian Christians, Anglo Indians,
                  Women and Backward Classes) were to be considered as a
                  minority, would be entitled to the right of
                  <b>separate electorate</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Gandhi reacted strongly to the proposal. He thought that there
                  was no need to protect the depressed classes through
                  representation, rather the need was to eradicate
                  untouchability.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Gandhi restored to <b>fast unto death</b> in Yervada Jail
                  (Poona) against this separate electorate for depressed class,
                  which Ambedkar was insisting on. This resulted into the
                  Poona-Pact between Gandhi and Ambedkar on 25th September,
                  1932.
                </li>
                <li>
                  147 seats were to be alloted to the depressed classes in the
                  provincial legislature as against 71 provided by the Communal
                  Award. The pact also called for adequate representation of
                  depressed classes in civil services.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Gandhiji coined the word <b>Harijan</b> for depressed classes
                  and their upliftment became his prime concern.

              <h3>Third Round Table Conference</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Held in London in 1932.</li>
                <li>The Congress did not participate.</li>
                <li>The discussion led to Government of India Act, 1935.</li>

              <h2>Government of India Act, 1935</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  In 1935, after the Round Table Conferences, Parliament passed
                  the Government of India Act 1935, which authorised the
                  establishment of independent legislative assemblies in all
                  provinces of British India, the creation of a central
                  government incorporating both the British provinces and the
                  princely states, and the protection of Muslim minorities.
                </li>
                <li>
                  However, it divided the electorate into religious and social
                  categories each of which was given separate representation in
                  the Provincial Legislative Assemblies. A voter could cast a
                  vote only for candidates in his own category.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The 1935 Act provided for more autonomy for Indian provinces,
                  with the goal of cooling off nationalist sentiment. The act
                  provided for a national parliament and an executive branch
                  under the purview of the British government, but the rulers of
                  the princely states managed to block its implementation. These
                  states remained under the full control of their hereditary
                  rulers, with no popular government.
                </li>

              <p>
                In the<b> 1937 elections </b> Congress won victories in seven of
                the eleven provinces of British India. Congress governments,
                with wide powers, were formed in these provinces. The widespread
                voter support for the Indian National Congress surprised Raj
                officials, who previously had seen the Congress as a small
                elitist body.
