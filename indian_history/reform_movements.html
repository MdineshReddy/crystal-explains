              <ul>
                <li>
                  The period from 19th century saw the emergence of
                  socio-religious reforms. The adverse impact of british rule,
                  religious superstitions among the masses, depressing Position
                  of Women etc made the newly emerging educated middle class
                  intellectuals to spread awareness and fight against the
                  various socio-religious ills plaguing the Indian society.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Raja Rammohan Roy and the Brahmo Samaj</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Raja Rammohan Roy (1772-1833), often regarded as the father of
                  Indian Renaissance and the 'maker of Modern India' is a
                  pioneer of socio-religious reform movements in modern India.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In 1814, he set up the Atmiya Sabha (or Society of Friends) in
                  Calcutta to propagate the monotheistic ideals of the Vedanta
                  and to campaign against idolatry, caste rigidities,
                  meaningless rituals and other social ills.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He founded Brahmo Sabha in 1828 which was later renamed Brahmo
                  Samaj. Through the Sabha he wanted to purify Hinduism and to
                  preach monotheism based on the twin pillars of reason and the
                  Vedas and Upanishads.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He protested againt the child marriage, polygamy, purdah
                  system and female infacticide. He favored the remarriage of
                  widows, female education and women’s right of Inheritance and
                  property.
                </li>

                <li>
                  He started a Bengali weekly newspaper
                  <b>Samvad Kaumudi</b> and edited a Persian weekly
                  <b>Mirat- ul- akbhar</b> .
                </li>

                <li>
                  Rammohan was a determined crusader against the inhuman
                  practice of sati. His efforts were rewarded by the Government
                  Regulation in 1829 which declared the practice of sati a
                  crime.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In 1817, he collaborated with David Hare to found the Hindu
                  college (now Presidency college, Calcutta).
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Young Bengal Movement and Henry Vivian Derozio</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The Young Bengal was a group of Bengali free thinkers emerging
                  from Hindu College, Calcutta.
                </li>
                <li>
                  They were also known as Derozians, after their teacher at
                  Hindu College, Henry Louis Vivian Derozio. The Young Bengals
                  were inspired and excited by the spirit of free thought and
                  revolt against the existing social and religious structure of
                  Hindu society. The Derozians also supported women’s rights and
                  education.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The great scholar and reformer, Vidyasagar’s ideas were a
                  happy blend of Indian and Western thought.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Vidyasagar started a movement in support of widow remarriage
                  which resulted in legalisation of widow remarriage ( Widow
                  Remarriage Act 1856). He was also a crusader against child
                  marriage and polygamy.
                </li>
                <li>
                  As secretary of Bethune School (established in 1849), he was
                  one of the pioneers of higher education for women in India.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Swami Dayanand Saraswathi and the Arya Samaj</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Dayananda Saraswati founded the Arya Samaj, a reform movement
                  of the Vedic dharma.
                </li>
                <li>
                  His society strove against idolatry, polytheism, rituals,
                  priesthood, animal sacrifice, child marriage and the caste
                  system. He worked towards reviving Vedic ideologies.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He was the first to give the call for
                  <b>Swaraj</b>
                  as "India for Indians" in 1876, a call later taken up by
                  Lokmanya Tilak.
                </li>
                <li>
                  His vision of India included a classless and casteless
                  society, a united India. He gave the slogan
                  <b> “Back to the Vedas”</b>.

                <li>Jyotirao was social reformer from Maharashtra.</li>
                <li>
                  He strived for eradication of untouchability, educating women
                  and exploited caste people.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He and his wife, Savitribai Phule started their first school
                  for girls in 1848 in Pune.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He, along with his followers, formed the
                  <b>Satyashodhak Samaj</b>
                  (Society of Truth Seekers) to attain equal rights for people
                  from exploited castes.
                </li>
                <li>

              <h3>Ramakrishna Movement and Swami Vivekananda</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The teachings of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa (1836-1886), a poor
                  priest at the Kali temple in Dakshineshwar, on the outskirts
                  of Calcutta found many followers.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He did not write books, but his conversations with people
                  formed the basis of what were considered his teachings. But
                  what he said was of universal relevance.
                </li>
                <li>Two objectives of the Ramakrishna movement were—</li>
                <ul style="list-style-type: square">
                  <li>
                    to bring into existence a band of monks dedicated to a life
                    of renunciation and practical spirituality, from among whom
                    teachers and workers would be sent out to spread the
                    universal message of Vedanta.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    lay disciples were to carry on preaching, philanthropic and
                    charitable works, looking upon all men, women and children,
                    irrespective of caste, creed or colour.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <li>
                  Paramahamsa himself laid the foundations of the Ramakrishna
                  Math with his young monastic disciples as a nucleus to fulfil
                  the first objective.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The second objective was taken up by Swami Vivekananda after
                  Ramakrishna’s death when he founded the Ramakrishna Mission in
                  1897.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Narendranath Datta (1862-1902), who later came to be known as
                  Swami Vivekananda spread Ramakrishna’s message.
                </li>
                <li>
                  At the <b>Parliament of Religions held at Chicago in 1893</b>,
                  Swami Vivekananda made a great impression on people by his
                  learned interpretations.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In 1897 he founded the Ramakrishna Mission dedicated for
                  humanitarian relief and social work.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The headquarters of the Ramakrishna Math and Mission are at
                  Belur near Calcutta.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Theosophical Society</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The Theosophical society was founded in New York (later
                  shifted to Madras) in 1875 by Madam H.P. Blavatsky (Russian) ,
                  and Colonel Henry Steel Olcott (American).
                </li>
                <li>
                  In India, the movement became somewhat popular with the
                  election of <b>Annie Besant</b> (1847-1933) as its president
                  after the death of Olcott in 1907.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The society believed that a special relationship could be
                  established between a person’s soul and God by contemplation,
                  prayer, revelation, etc.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It accepted the Hindu beliefs in reincarnation and karma, and
                  drew inspiration from the philosophy of the Upanishads and
                  samkhya, yoga and Vedanta schools of thought.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It aimed to work for universal brotherhood of humanity without
                  distinction of race, creed, sex, caste or colour.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Sir Sayyid Ahmed Khan and the Aligarh Movement</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The Aligarh movement was started by Sir Syed Ahmad Khan
                  (1817-98).
                </li>

                <li>
                  The movement aimed at spreading (i) modern education among
                  Indian Muslims without weakening their allegiance to Islam;
                  (ii) social reforms among Muslims relating to purdah,
                  polygamy, widow remarriage, women’s education, slavery,
                  divorce, etc.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He wanted to reconcile Western scientific education with the
                  teachings of the Quran which were to be interpreted in the
                  light of contemporary rationalism and science.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In 1875, he founded a modern school at Aligarh to promote
                  English education among the Muslim. This had later grown into
                  the Mohammadan Anglo Oriental college and then into the
                  Aligarh Muslim University.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Deoband Movement</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  This was started in 1867 in Deoband in UP by theologians,
                  Muhammad Qasim Nanotavi and Rashid Ahmad Gangohi.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In contrast to the Aligarh Movement, which aimed at the
                  welfare of Muslims through Western education, the aim of the
                  Deoband Movement was moral and religious regeneration of the
                  Muslim community.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Self-Respect Movement by E.V. Ramaswamy Naicker</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  This movement was started by E.V. Ramaswamy Naicker (or
                  Periyar Ramaswamy) in the mid-1920s in Tamil Nadu. He is known
                  as the 'Father of the Dravidian movement'.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He rebelled against Brahminical dominance and gender and caste
                  inequality in Tamil Nadu. He deleted the caste title Naicker
                  from his name.
                </li>
                <li>
                  His movement aimed at rejection of the brahminical religion
                  and culture which he felt was the prime instrument of
                  exploitation of the lower castes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  E.V. Ramasamy promoted the principles of rationalism,
                  self-respect, women’s rights and eradication of caste. He
                  opposed the exploitation and marginalisation of the
                  non-Brahmin Dravidian people of South India and the imposition
                  of what he considered Indo-Aryan India.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A number of political parties in Tamil Nadu, such as Dravida
                  Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and All India Anna Dravida Munnetra
                  Kazhagam (AIADMK) owe their ideological origins to the
                  Self-respect movement.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Temple Entry Movement by S Narayana Guru</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Narayana Guru was a social reformer from Kerala whose family
                  belonged to Ezhava caste.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He led a reform movement against the injustice in the then
                  caste-ridden society of Kerala in order to promote spiritual
                  enlightenment and social equality.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In 1888, he visited Aruvippuram (in Thiruvananthapuram) where
                  he meditated for a while and during his stay there, he
                  consecrated a piece of rock taken from the river, as the idol
                  of Shiva, which has since become the Aruvippuram Shiva Temple.
                  The upper caste Brahmins questioned Guru's right to consecrate
                  the idol. He replied to them
                  <i>
                    <b>"This is not a Brahmin Shiva but an Ezhava Shiva"</b></i
                  >
                  . This became a famous quote, used against casteism.
