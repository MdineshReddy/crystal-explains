              <h1 class="title">THE VEDIC AGE</h1>
              <p>
                The Vedic period or Vedic age is the period in the late Bronze
                Age and early Iron Age of the history of India.
              </p>
              <h2>Origins of the Aryans</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The location of the original homeland of the Aryans is still
                  controversial, but the most accepted theory is that they
                  migrated from Central Asia in several groups between 2000-1500
                  BCE and settled in Eastern Pakistan and India.
                </li>
                <li>
                  This region is popularly known as the land of seven rivers or
                  <b>‘Sapta Sindhu’</b> which include the Indus, its five
                  tributaries i.e., Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, Beas and Sutlej and
                  the Saraswati (identified as the modern-day Ghaggar-Hakra
                  river).
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h2>Rigvedic or Early Vedic Period (1500-1000 BC)</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <ul>
                <li>Early Vedic people lived in the region of Sapta Sindhu.</li>
                <li>
                  Aryans came into conflict with the indigenous inhabitants
                  called Dasas and Dasyus (earlier branch of Aryans). Dasyuhatya
                  or slaughter of Dasyus is repeatedly mentioned in the Rig
                  Veda.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <div class="note">
                Accounts of military conflicts inbetween the various tribes of
                Vedic Aryans are described in the Rigveda. Most notable of such
                conflicts was the <b>Battle of Ten Kings</b> (Dasrajan war),
                which took place on the banks of the river Parushni (modern day
                Ravi).
              </div>
              <h3>Polity and Society</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Rig Vedic society was a tribal society and its people lived a
                  seminomadic life. Aryan tribes were called <b>Janas</b>. Their
                  chief (rajan) was known as the <b>Gopati</b> or
                  <b>Gopa</b> (protector of cows), and the chief queen was
                  called the <b>Mahisi</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The society’s political structure was somewhat similar to the
                  monarchial form, but the Gopati’s office was not hereditary
                  and he was selected among the clan’s men.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Occupation was not based on birth. Members of a family could
                  adopt different occupations.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Varna or color was the basis of initial differentiation
                  between the Vedic and non-Vedic people. The only mention of
                  the four varnas was found in the <b>Purusashukta</b> of the
                  tenth Mandal of the Rig Veda, which makes one conclude that
                  the varna system was probably introduced at the end of the Rig
                  Vedic age. However, the Rig Vedic people were familiar with
                  slavery.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Kula</b> (Family) was the basic social unit and
                  <b>Kulapa</b> was the head of the family. They followed the
                  patrilineal system. The family was part of a larger grouping,
                  called <b>vis</b> or clan. One or more than one clan made
                  <b>jana</b> or tribe. The jana was the largest social unit.
                  <b>Kula &rightarrow; Vis &rightarrow; Jana.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  There was no regular or standing army. Military technique was
                  much advanced as they possessed chariots driven by horses.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Some important tribal assemblies of this period were Sabha,
                  Samithi, Vidatha and Gana:
                </li>
                <ul style="list-style-type: square">
                  <li>
                    The two most important Assemblies were the Sabha and Samiti.
                    Samiti was general in nature and less exclusive than Sabha.
                  </li>
                  <li>Women attended Sabha and Vidhata in Rigvedic times</li>
                </ul>
              </ul>
              <h3>Economy</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Rigvedic Aryans followed a mixed economy consisting of both
                  agriculture and pastoralism.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Pastoralism was their primary occupation while agriculture was
                  secondary.

                  Cow was the most important form of wealth. The term for war in
                  the Rig Veda is Gavishthi or search for cows. The horse was
                  almost as important as cow.

                  There was no regular system of taxation. People gave voluntary

              <div class="underline"></div>
              <h3>Polity</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Tribal assemblies lost their importance and royal power
                  increased at their cost. Sabha and Samities continued to hold
                  ground, though not like the Rig Vedic Age, but the vidatha
                  completely disappeared. Women were no longer permitted to
                  attend assemblies.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Formation of large kingdoms, Kingship became completely
                  hereditary.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The term <b>Rashtra</b> indicating territory, first appeared
                  in this period. The wars were no longer fought for cows, but
                  for territories. It should be noted that even in Later Vedic
                  times, the king did not possess a standing army and tribal
                  units were mustered in times of war.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The king’s influence was further strengthened by ritual
                  enactments such as the <b>Rajasuya</b> (which was royal
                  consecration and conferred supreme power on the king),
                  <b>Vajapeya</b>(a chariot race in which royal chariot was made
                  to win against all kinsmen), and
                  <b>Aswamedha</b> (unquestioned control over an area in which
                  the royal horse ran uninterrupted).
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Society</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The fourfold division of society became clearer. Initially
                  based on occupation, it later became hereditary.
                </li>
                <ul style="list-style-type: square">
                  <li>
                    <b>Brahmana</b>: The growing cult of sacrifice enormously
                    added to the power of Brahmins.

                    <b>Vaisyas</b>: The working class. They were the
                    agriculturalists, cattle rearers, traders, artisans and
                    metal workers.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Shudras</b>: Lowest in the social hierarchy and

                <li>
                  As compared to the Rig Vedic age, women lost importance in the
                  society and there have been references to rare instances of
                  sati and child marriage.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Economy</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The Later Vedic culture is also called as
                  <b>PGW–Iron Phase culture</b>, as a particular kind of pottery
                  (painted grey ware) was used during that phase.
                </li>
                <li>Agriculture became the chief economic activity.</li>
                <li>
                  The main factor in the expansion of the Aryan culture during
                  the Later Vedic period was the beginning of the use of iron,
                  which was introduced around 1000 BCE.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Unlike the Rig Vedic age where only voluntary offerings were
                  taken and per se no revenue collection was done, in the Later
                  Vedic age, collection of taxes and tributes was made mandatory
                  and were done by
                  <b>Sangrihitri.</b>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Religion</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The Later Vedic culture was focused on the centrality of the
                  cult of sacrifice. Sacrifice became more important and
                  elaborate, and assumed both public and domestic character.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The two most important Rig Vedic Gods, Indra and Agni, lost
                  their importance and instead of them, Prajapati (the creator)
                  became supreme. Some of the other minor gods became prominent,
                  such as Vishnu (conceived as the preserver and protector of
                  people).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Idolatry appears in late Vedic phase and just as the society
                  was divided in the later Vedic phase in terms of social
                  classes, similarly some of the social orders too adopted their
                  own deities. For example, Pushan (who was supposed to look
                  after cattle) came to be regarded as the god of the Shudras.
                </li>
                <li>
                  However, towards the end of Later Vedic age, a strong reaction
                  began to emerge against priestly domination, against cults and
                  sacrifices. Around 600 BCE, the Upanishads were compiled.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Ayur Veda</b> (Upaveda of Rig Veda): Deals with medicine.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  The Brahmanas describe the rules for the performance of
                  sacrificial ceremonies. They explain the hymns of the Vedas in
                  an
                  <b> orthodox (i.e., traditional) manner</b>.

                  They are called the <b>‘forest books’</b> as they were written
                  mainly by hermits living in the jungles for their pupils. They
                  deal with mysticism and philosophy and oppose sacrifice. They
                  emphasize meditation and are considered to be the concluding
                  portion of the Brahmanas, and interpret rituals in a
                  philosophical way.
                </li>
              </ul>

                  <b>‘to sit near someone’</b>. There are <b>108 Upanishads</b>.
                  The Upanishads dwell on the ‘Atman’ and ‘Brahman’, and focus a
                  lot on the philosophy about life, universe, self, body,
                  sacrifice, etc. They emphasize that the knowledge of the self
                  or atman should be acquired and that the relation of the atman
                  with the Brahman should be properly understood.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The <b>Mandukyopanishad</b> is the largest of all Upanishads

                <li>
                  Vedanta literally signifies the <b>‘end of the Vedas’</b>, as
                  they reveal the final aim of the Vedas. They condemn
                  sacrifices and ceremonies and denote the last phase of the
                  Vedic period.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Vedangas</h3>

              <h3>Puranas</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The word ‘puranas’ literally means <b>‘old’</b>. They were the
                  religious sectarian literature of later times (around 4th 6th
                  centuries), but have a well-defined perception of the past
                  traditions. They reflect the Brahmanical social and religious
                  values and also shed light on the emergence and development of
                  Hindu religious practices. The contents of Puranas generally
                  span of four ages/yugas (Satya, Treta, Dvapara, and Kali).
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Puranas are further divided into <b>18 Mahapuranas</b> and
                  numerous Upapuranas (secondary Puranas).
                  <b>Matsya Purana is the oldest.</b>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Dharamshastra</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  They are the Sanskrit texts dealing specifically with Dharma
                  (code of conduct that conceptually signifies
                  <b>‘a righteous moral law’</b> which is in consonance with the
                  universal natural law).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Manav Dharma Shastra or <b>Manusmriti</b> is the oldest and
                  most famous. Manu is supposed to be the first king and law
                  maker.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Epics</h3>
              <p>
                The two Sanskrit epics, the <b>Mahabharata</b> and the
                <b>Ramayana</b>, are part of both oral and written traditional
                history. The existing texts of these epics are believed to
                belong to the post-Vedic age, between c. 400 BCE and 400 CE.
              </p>
              <h4>Mahabharata</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The Mahabharata is said to be composed by <b>Ved Vyasa</b> and
                  consists of 18 Parvas (chapter) and has around
                  <b>1 lakh verses</b>. It is considerably longer than Ramayana.
                  It is believed to be older than Ramayana.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Bhagavad Gita is extracted from Bhishma Parva of Mahabharata.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Ramayana</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Ramayana is considered as the Adi-Kavya (first conscious
                  poetry) composed by <b>Valmiki</b> and it consists of seven
                  Kandas (books) having around <b>24,000 verses</b>. It is much
                  shorter than the Mahabharata, despite later additions.
