                The Indian National Congress and the Moderate Phase (1885-1905)
              </h1>
              <h2>Foundation of Indian National Congress</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  By 1880, a new middle class had arisen in India and spread
                  thinly across the country.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The encouragement felt by this class came from its success in
                  education and its ability to avail itself of the benefits of
                  that education such as employment in the Indian Civil Service.
                </li>
                <li>
                  They were especially encouraged when
                  <b>Canada was granted dominion status in 1867</b> and
                  established an autonomous democratic constitution.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A solid ground had been prepared for the establishment of an
                  <b>all-India organisation</b>. The final shape to this idea
                  was given by a retired English civil servant,
                  <b>A.O. Hume</b>, who mobilised leading intellectuals of the
                  time and, with their cooperation, organised the first session
                  of the Indian National Congress at Gokuldas Tejpal Sanskrit
                  College in <b> Bombay</b> in December <b>1885</b> with the
                  permission from the then viceroy <b>Lord Dufferin</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The membership comprised of the westernised elite and no
                  effort was made at this time to broaden the base.
                </li>

                <li>
                  The first session of the Indian National Congress was attended
                  by 72 delegates and presided over by
                  <b>Womesh Chandra Bonnerjee</b>. Hereafter, the Congress met
                  every year in December, in a different part of the country
                  each time.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The second session of the Congress was held in Calcutta in
                  1886 followed by the third in Madras in 1887.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h2>Foundational theories of INC</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <h3>Safety Valve Theory by Lala Lajpat Rai</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  There is a theory that Hume formed the Congress with the idea
                  that it would prove to be a <b>‘safety valve’</b> for
                  releasing the growing discontent of the Indians.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The extremist leaders like <b>Lala Lajpat Rai</b> believed in
                  the ‘safety valve’ theory.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Conspiracy Theory by R.P. Dutt</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Conspiracy theory was an offspring of the ‘safety valve’
                  notion.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>R.P. Dutt</b> opined that the Indian National Congress was
                  born out of a conspiracy to abort a popular uprising in India
                  and the bourgeois (middle-class) leaders were a party to it.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Lightning conductor Theory by G.K. Gokhale</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Modern Indian historians opinined the Indian National Congress
                  represented the urge of the politically conscious Indians to
                  set up a national body to express the political and economic
                  demands of the Indians.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In the circumstances, as <b>Bipin Chandra</b> observes, the
                  early Congress leaders used Hume as a ‘lightning conductor’
                  i.e., as a catalyst to bring together the nationalistic forces
                  even if under the guise of a ‘safety valve’.
                </li>

              <h2>Moderate Phase (1885-1905)</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <h3>Important leaders of Moderate Phase:</h3>
              <h4>Dadabhai Naoroji (1825-1917)</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  referred to as the "Grand Old Man of India". He was from
                  Gujarat.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He was the first Asian to be a British Member of Parliament in
                  the United Kingdom's House of Commons between 1892 and 1895.
                </li>
                <li>
                  His book <b>Poverty and Un-British Rule</b> in India brought
                  attention to his theory of the Indian
                  <b>"wealth drain"</b> into Britain.

                  Economic Critique of British Imperialism

                  <li>
                    The early nationalists, led by <b>Dadabhai Naoroji</b>,
                    carefully analysed the political economy of British rule in
                    India, and put forward the <b>“drain theory”</b> to explain
                    British exploitation of India.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    They opposed the transformation of a basically
                    self-sufficient Indian economy into a colonial economy
                    (i.e., a supplier of raw materials and food stuff, an
                    importer of finished goods and a field of investment for
                    British capital).

              <h4>Pherozeshah Mehta (1845-1915)</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>He was a politician and lawyer from Bombay.</li>
                <li>
                  He was one of the founding member and President of the Indian
                  National Congress.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He was knighted by the British Government in India for his
                  service to the law and hence referred to as Sir Pherozeshah
                  Mehta.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Gopal Krishna Gokhale (1866-1915)</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Gokhale was a senior leader of the Indian National Congress
                  and the founder of the <b>Servants of India Society</b>. He
                  was from Bombay.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Through the Society as well as the Congress and other
                  legislative bodies he served in, Gokhale campaigned for Indian
                  self-rule and for social reforms.
                </li>
                <li>
                  As a moderate he advocated reforms by working with existing
                  government institutions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Gokhale was famously a mentor to Mahatma Gandhi in the
                  latter's formative years. Gandhi also recognised Gokhale as an
                  admirable leader and master politician, describing him as
                  <i>
                    "pure as crystal, gentle as a lamb, brave as a lion and
                    chivalrous to a fault and the most perfect man in the
                    political field"</i
                  >.
                </li>

              <h4>Surendranath Banerjea (1848-1925)</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>He was from Bengal Presidency.</li>
                <li>
                  He founded a nationalist organization called the
                  <b> Indian National Association</b> (1876) along with
                  Anandamohan Bose.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Banerjee later became a senior member of the Indian National
                  Congress.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He was not content with the Montagu–Chelmsford Reforms (1919),
                  unlike Congress, and with many liberal leaders he left
                  Congress and founded a new organisation named
                  <b> Indian National Liberation Federation</b> in 1919.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Madan Mohan Malaviya (1861-1946)</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya was a three times president of
                  Indian National Congress and the founder of Akhil Bharatiya
                  Hindu Mahasabha.
                </li>
                <li>He was referred to as <b>Mahamana</b>.</li>
                <li>
                  Malaviya strived to promote modern education among Indians and
                  eventually cofounded Banaras Hindu University (BHU) at
                  Varanasi in 1916
                </li>
                <li>
                  Malaviya founded a highly influential, English-newspaper,
                  <b>The Leader</b> published in 1909. He was also the Chairman
                  of Hindustan Times from 1924 to 1946.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <br />

              <p>
                <b>Othe Prominent Leaders:</b> P. Ananda Charlu, Romesh Chandra
                Dutt, Ananda Mohan Bose, Rash Behari Ghosh etc.
              </p>
              <h3>Moderate Approach</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The moderate political activity involved
                  <b>constitutional agitation</b> within the confines of law and
                  showed a slow but orderly political progress.
                </li>
                <li>
                  They were staunch believers in <b>‘liberalism’</b> and
                  ‘moderate’ politics and came to be labelled as
                  <b>Moderates</b> to distinguish them from the neo-nationalists
                  of the early twentieth century who were referred to as the
                  <b>Extremists.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Moderates believed that the British basically wanted to be
                  just to the Indians but were not aware of the real conditions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Therefore, if public opinion could be created in the country
                  and public demands be presented to the government through
                  resolutions, petitions, meetings, etc., the authorities would
                  concede these demands gradually.
                </li>
                <li>
                  To achieve these ends, they worked on a two-pronged
                  methodology:
                </li>
                <ul style="list-style-type: square">
                  <li>
                    create a strong public opinion to arouse consciousness and
                    national spirit and then educate and unite people on common
                    political questions and
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    persuade the British Government and British public opinion
                    to introduce reforms in India on the lines laid out by the
                    nationalists.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <li>
                  Their approach could be summed up in three words 'prayer,
                  petition and protest'. They used the method of
                  <b>‘prayer and petition’</b> and if that failed, they resorted
                  to constitutional agitation (i.e., protest).
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Achievements of the Moderates</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Their demands for constitutional reforms were meant to have
                  been conceded in the form of the
                  <b> Indian Councils Act 1892</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Indian Councils Act 1892:</b>
                </li>
                <ul style="list-style-type: square">
                  <li>
                    Number of additional members in Imperial Legislative
                    Councils and the Provincial Legislative Councils was raised.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Legislative Councils were given more functions such as the
                    discussion of budget and addressing questions to the
                    executive.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Indirect elections (nominations) were introduced in central
                    and provincial legislative councils.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <li>
                  These reforms were severely criticised at Congress sessions.
                  Now, they demanded:
                </li>
                <ol>
                  <li>a majority of elected Indians, and</li>
                  <li>
                    control over the budget, i.e., the power to vote upon and
                    amend the budget.
                  </li>
                </ol>
                <li>
                  They gave the slogan—“No taxation without representation”.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h2>Limitations of the moderates</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  This phase of the national movement was dominated by the
                  educated elites.
                </li>
                <li>
                  They never strived or felt the need to involve the masses as
                  Gandhi did links-container-back.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Their affection for western political thinking further
                  alienated them from the people.
                </li>
                <li>
                  They never demanded complete independence from British and
                  were contented with dominion status with greater autonomy and
                  self-rule .
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h2>An Evaluation of the Early Nationalists</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The early nationalists did a great deal to awaken the national
                  sentiment, even though they could not draw the masses to them.
                </li>
                <ul style="list-style-type: square">
                  <li>
                    They represented the most progressive forces of the time.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    They were able to create a wide national awakening of all
                    Indians having common interests and the need to rally around
                    a common programme against a common enemy, and above all,
                    the feeling of belonging to one nation.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    They exposed the basically exploitative character of
                    colonial rule, thus undermining its moral foundations.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    They created a solid base for a more vigorous, militant,
                    mass-based national movement in the years that followed.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <li>
                  However, they <b>failed to widen their democratic base</b> and
                  the scope of their demands.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <br />
              <p>
                Because of the lack of mass participation, the Moderates could
                not take important political positions against the authorities.
                The later nationalists differed from the Moderates precisely on
                this point. Still, the early nationalists represented the
                emerging Indian nation against colonial interests.
