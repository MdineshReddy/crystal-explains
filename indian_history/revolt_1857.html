              <h1 class="title">THE REVOLT OF 1857</h1>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  A century after the Battle of Plassey (1757), that started the
                  british rule in India, the major Revolt of 1857 took place
                  which resulted in British changing their policy of ruling in
                  India. It is also known as India’s First War of Independence
                  or Sepoy Mutiny.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It is important to note that the period between 1757 and 1857
                  was not all peaceful and trouble-free; it saw a series of
                  sporadic popular outbursts in the form of religio-political
                  violence, tribal movements, peasant uprisings, agrarian riots,
                  military revolts and civil rebellions.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h2>Causes of the rebellion</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                The Indian revolt of 1857 occurred as the result of an
                accumulation of factors over time, rather than any single event.
                These factors can be listed as follows:
              </p>
              <h3>Economic Causes</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Impoverished by <b>heavy taxation</b>, the peasants resorted
                  to loans from money-lenders/traders at usurious rates, the
                  latter often evicting the former from their land on
                  non-payment of debt dues.
                </li>
                <li>
                  British rule also meant misery to the artisans and handicrafts
                  people. The annexation of Indian states by the Company cut off
                  their major source of patronage—the native rulers and the
                  nobles, who could not now afford to be patrons of the crafts
                  workers.
                  <b
                    >British policy discouraged Indian handicrafts and promoted
                    British goods.
                  </b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Indian trade and mercantile class was deliberately
                  crippled by the British who imposed
                  <b>high tariff duties</b> on Indian-made goods. At the same
                  time, the import of British goods into India attracted low
                  tariffs, thus encouraging their entry into India. By
                  mid-nineteenth century, exports of cotton and silk textiles
                  from India practically came to an end.

                  British Land Revenue Systems in India
                </h3>
                <h4>Permanent Settlement (or) Zamindari System</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Introduced in Bengal, Bihar and Orissa, districts of Banaras
                    and Northern districts of Madras by
                    <b>Lord Cornwallis</b> in 1793.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Under the Pernmanent Settlement, zamindars were recognised
                    as the owners of the land. Hence, they could keep 1/11th of
                    the revenue collected to themselves while the British got a
                    <b>fixed</b> share of 10/11th of the revenue collected.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    The zamindars were free to fix the rent. The
                    ryots(cultivators) were considered tenents/ tillers of soil.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Under Permanent settlement, zamindars lost their
                    administrative and judicial functions. They were performed
                    by the Company now.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If a zamindar did not pay the fixed amount, his property
                    could be seized and sold.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Ryotwari Settlement</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    This system of land revenue was instituted in the late 18th
                    century by
                    <b>Sir Thomas Munro</b>, Governor of Madras Presidency.
                  </li>
                  <li>It was introduced in Bombay, Madras and Assam.</li>
                  <li>
                    In this, the direct settlement was made between the
                    Government and the Ryots i.e., peasants/cultivators who are
                    regarded as the owners of the land.
                  </li>

                    The revenue was based on the basis of the quality of the
                    soil and the nature of the crop. It was based on the
                    <b>‘Scientific Rent Theory of Ricardo.’</b>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The position of the cultivator became more secure. But the
                    rates were high and unlike the Permanent System, they were
                    open to being increased.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Mahalwari System</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Introduced in the area of Ganga valley, North-West Frontier
                    Provinces parts of Central India and Punjab by
                    <b> Lord William Bentinck</b>.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Under this system, a basic unit of revenue settlement was
                    Village termed as ‘Mahal’. Sometimes, a Mahal was
                    constituted more than one village.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The village land belonged jointly to the village community,
                    they were responsible for payment of revenue. Revenue was
                    collected by the village headman or village leaders.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    This system was called the Modified Zamindari system because
                    the village headman virtually became a Zamindar.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <p>
                These revenue systems were highly exploitative. Thus the
                peasants resented the British Government. When the revolt broke
                out in 1857, they actively participated to overthrow the british
                government.
              </p>
              <h3>Political Causes</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The East India Company’s greedy policies of ‘Subsidiary
                  Alliance’ and ‘Doctrine of Lapse’ caused suspicion in the
                  minds of almost all the ruling princes in India
                </li>
                <li>
                  Those rulers, who lost their states to the British, were
                  naturally against the British and took sides against them
                  during the revolt.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The collapse of rulers adversely affected those sections of
                  the Indian society which derived their sustenance from
                  cultural and religious pursuits.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Administrative Causes</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Rampant corruption in the Company’s administration. It is the
                  view of many historians that the rampant corruption we see now
                  in India is a legacy of the Company rule.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Socio-Religious Causes</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Racial overtones and a superiority complex characterised the
                  British administrative attitude towards the native Indian
                  population.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The attempts at socio-religious reform such as abolition of
                  sati, support to widow-marriage and women’s education were
                  seen by a large section of the population as interference in
                  the social and religious domains of Indian society by
                  outsiders.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h2>Outbreak of the Revolt</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <h3>Immediate Cause of the Outbreak</h3>
              <p>
                The immediate factor was the introduction of the
                <b>‘Enfield’ rifle</b> . The greased wrapping paper of the
                cartridge of the new rifle had to be bitten off before loading.
                There were rumours that the grease was reportedly made of beef
                and pig fat. The cow was sacred to the Hindus while the pig was
                taboo for the Muslims. The sepoys felt their religion was in
                grave danger.

              <h3>The Revolt Starts</h3>
              <p>
                The revolt <b>began at Meerut (UP)</b>, 58 km from Delhi, on May
                10, 1857 and then, gathering force rapidly, soon embraced a vast
                area from the Punjab in the north and the Narmada in the south
                to Bihar in the east and Rajputana in the west.
              </p>
              <p>
                Even before the Meerut incident, there were series of rebellions
                in various cantonments.
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  The 19th Native Infantry at Berhampore (West Bengal), which
                  refused to use the newly introduced Enfield rifle and broke
                  out in mutiny in February 1857 was disbanded in March 1857.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A young sepoy of the 34th Native Infantry,
                  <b>Mangal Pandey</b>, went a step further and fired at the
                  sergeant major of his unit at Barrackpore (West Bengal). He
                  was overpowered and executed on April 8 while his regiment was
                  disbanded in May.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The 7th Awadh Regiment which defied its officers on May 3 met
                  with a similar fate.
                </li>
                <li>
                  On 10th May, 1857, the sepoys at Meerut refused to use Enfiled
                  Rifles and revolted. The mutiny spread throughout Uttar
                  Pradesh and sepoys moved to Delhi crying
                  <b> March to Delhi.</b>
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                At Delhi, the Mughal ruler <b>Bahadur Shah II</b> was declared
                <b>‘Shahenshah-i-Hindustan’</b>(emperor of India). Bahadur Shah,
                after initial vacillation, wrote letters to all the chiefs and
                rulers of India urging them to organise a confederacy of Indian
                states to fight and replace the British regime.
              </p>

              <h3>Various Storm Centres and Leaders of the Revolt</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  At Delhi the nominal and symbolic leadership belonged to the
                  Mughal emperor, Bahadur Shah. But the real command lay with a
                  court of soldiers headed by <b>General Bakht Khan</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  At <b>Kanpur</b> (UP), the natural choice was
                  <b>Nana Saheb</b>, the adopted son of the last peshwa, Baji
                  Rao II. He was refused the family title and banished from
                  Poona, and was living near Kanpur. Nana Saheb expelled the
                  English from Kanpur, proclaimed himself the peshwa,
                  acknowledged Bahadur Shah as the Emperor of India and declared
                  himself to be his governor.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b> Begum Hazrat Mahal</b> took over the reigns at
                  <b>Lucknow</b> where the rebellion broke out.
                </li>
                <li>
                  At <b>Bareilly</b> (UP), <b> Khan Bahadur</b>, a descendant of
                  the former ruler of Rohilkhand, was placed in command.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In <b>Bihar</b>, the revolt was led by <b>Kunwar Singh.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Maulvi Ahmadullah</b> of <b>Faizabad</b> (UP) was another
                  outstanding leader of the revolt.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The most iconic leader of the revolt was
                  <b>Rani Laxmibai</b>, who assumed the leadership of the sepoys
                  at <b>Jhansi</b> (UP). Lord Dalhousie, the governor-general,
                  had refused to allow her adopted son to succeed to the throne
                  after her husband died, and had annexed the state by the
                  application of the infamous ‘Doctrine of Lapse’. Driven out of
                  Jhansi by British forces, she gave the battle cry—”main apni
                  Jhansi nahin doongi” (I shall not give away my Jhansi). She
                  was joined by <b>Tantia Tope</b>, a close associate of Nana
                  Saheb, after the loss of Kanpur. The Rani of Jhansi and Tantia
                  Tope marched towards Gwalior (Madhya Pradesh) where they were
                  hailed by the Indian soldiers.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Suppression of the Revolt</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The British captured Delhi on September 20, 1857 after
                  prolonged and bitter fighting. Bahadur Shah was taken
                  prisoner. The royal princes were captured and were publicly
                  shot. The emperor was exiled to Rangoon (Myanmar) where he
                  died in 1862. Thus the great House of Mughals was finally and
                  completely extinguished.
                </li>
                <li>One by one, all the great leaders of the revolt fell.</li>
                <ul style="list-style-type: square">
                  <li>
                    Kanpur and Lucknow were recovered. Nana Saheb, defeated at
                    Kanpur, escaped to Nepal in early 1859, never to be heard of
                    again.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    His close associate Tantia Tope escaped into the jungles of
                    central India, but was captured while asleep in April 1859
                    and put to death.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The Rani of Jhansi had died on the battlefield earlier in
                    June 1858.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    By 1859, Kunwar Singh of Bihar, Bakht Khan of Delhi, Khan
                    Bahadur Khan of Bareilly and Maulvi Ahmadullah of Faizabad
                    were all dead.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <li>
                  By the end of 1859, British authority over India was fully
                  re-established.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h2>Causes Behind the Failure of the Revolt</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <ul>
                <li>Lack of unity and poor organisation of the revolt.</li>
                <li>
                  All the classes of the society were not effected or
                  participated in the revolt. Some of the rulers even helped
                  Britishers in reppressing the revolt.
                </li>
                <li>No common motive for participating in the revolt.</li>
                <li>
                  The military equipments of rebels were inferior to those of
                  the British.
                </li>
                <li>Majorly northern India was affected by this revolt.</li>
              </ul>
              <h2>Consequences</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  In August 1858, the British Parliament passed the
                  <b>Government of India Act, 1858</b> which put an end to the
                  rule of the Company. The responsibility of the administration
                  of British India passed into the hands of the British Crown
                  and the Parliament.
                </li>
                <li>
                  An office of the <b>Secretary of State for India</b> with a
                  <b>15 member's council</b>
                  was constituted for the administration of India.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The designation of the Governor-General of India was changed
                  to
                  <b> Viceroy</b>, who was to act as a representative of British
                  Parliament in India.
                </li>
                <li>
                  ‘Doctrine of Lapse’ was withdrawn. Princely states were
                  assured against annexation.
                </li>
                <li>The number of White Soldiers in the army was increased.</li>
