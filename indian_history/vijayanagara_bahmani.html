              <h2>The Vijayanagara Kingdom (1336-1650 AD)</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The Vijayanagara Kingdom (also known as Karnata Rajya)
                  constituted four dynasties —
                </li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Sangama (1336–1485 AD),</li>
                  <li>Saluva (1485–1503 AD),</li>
                  <li>Tuluva (1503–1570 AD) and</li>
                  <li>Aravidu (till the end of the 17th century).</li>
                </ul>
                <li>
                  It included people from different cultural regions (the Tamil,
                  Telugu and Kannada regions) who all spoke different languages
                  and belonged to different cultures.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In the south, Vijayanagara’s main rivals were the
                  <b>Sultans of Madurai</b> and the struggle between them
                  continued for almost four decades. By c.1377 CE, the Sultanate
                  of Madurai was wiped out.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In the north, they had continuous hostility with the
                  <b>Bahmani Sultanate</b>.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>The Sangamas (1336-1485 AD)</h3>
              <h4>Harihara I and Bukka Raya I (1336–1377 AD)</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Founders of the Sangama dynasty of Vijayanagar kingdom.</li>
                <li>
                  Originally feudatories of the
                  <b>Kakatiyas of Warangal,</b> Muhammad bin Tughlaq imprisoned
                  the two brothers and were converted to Islam.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Later, they returned to the Hindu fold at the initiative of
                  the
                  <b>saint Vidyaranya</b>. They also proclaimed their
                  independence and to commemorate the memory of their guru, the
                  brothers founded a new city of
                  <b> Vidyanagar or Vijayanagara</b> (meaning city of victory)
                  on the south bank of river <b>Tungabhadra</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The decline of the Hoysala kingdom enabled Harihara and Bukka
                  raya to expand their newly founded kingdom.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Bukka raya succeeded his brother in c.1356 and ruled till 1377
                  CE. During his reign, the Sultanate of Madurai was eliminated.
                  He also defeated the chiefdom of Arcot (Tamil Nadu), the
                  Reddys of Kondavidu (AP), and gained control over Goa.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Harihara II (1377–1406 AD)</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Harihara II, the second son of Bukka Raya I, further
                  consolidated the kingdom beyond the Krishna River.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Deva Raya I (1406–1422 AD)</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The next ruler, Deva Raya I, emerged successful against the
                  Gajapatis of Odisha and undertook important works of
                  fortification and irrigation.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He constructed a dam across river Tungabhadra to bring canals
                  into the city to relieve the shortage of water.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Early in his career, he was defeated by the Bahmani ruler
                  <b>Firoz Shah</b> and had to not only pay a huge indemnity but
                  also had to marry his daughter to the Sultan. In c. 1420 CE,
                  Firoz Shah invaded Pangal, which had been taken by
                  Vijayanagar, but this time Deva Raya inflicted a shattering
                  defeat on Firoz Shah. The Sultan had to hand over the southern
                  and eastern districts of his kingdom to Deva Raya I.
                  Consequently, by c. 1422, Deva Raya I came to control
                  territory up to the Krishna– Tungabhadra doab including
                  Pangal.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Srinatha</b> was his court poet, who wrote
                  <b>Haravilasam</b>, a poetic composition in Telugu. He was
                  widely regarded as the <b>Kavi Sarvabhowma</b> (The emperor
                  among poets).
