              <h2>The Conquest of Bengal</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Bengal was the richest province of the Mughal Empire which
                  included present day Bangladesh. Its Nawab had authority over
                  the region constituting present day states of Bihar and Odisha
                  as well.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In 1700, <b>Murshid Quli Khan</b> became the Governor of
                  Bengal. He was succeeded by his son-in-law,
                  <b>Shujauddin</b> who ruled till 1739. After that, for a year
                  (1739-40), <b>Sarfaraz Khan</b>, an incapable son of Murshid
                  Quli Khan, became the ruler; he was killed by
                  <b>Alivardi Khan.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Alivardi Khan ruled till 1756 and also stopped paying tributes
                  to the Mughal emperior. He was succeeded by his grandson,
                  <b>Siraj-ud-daula</b>, the son of his youngest daughter.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Almost all the governors of Bengal strongly resented the
                  special privileges enjoyed by the English company as it meant
                  a huge loss to the State.
                </li>
                <li><b> The Battle of Plassey</b></li>
                <ul style="list-style-type: square">
                  <li>
                    <b>Cause of the Battle:</b> The officials of the Company
                    made rampant <b>misuse of its trade privileges</b> that
                    adversely affected the nawab’s finances. The English
                    <b>fortified Calcutta without the nawab’s permission</b>.
                    Mention may be made here of the much propagated
                    <b>‘Black Hole Tragedy’</b>. In June of 1756 the British
                    governor of Calcutta, <b>Roger Drake</b> made the mistake of
                    insulting the emissary sent by the
                    <b>Nawab Siraj ud-Daulah</b> who duly besieged and captured
                    the British garrison. Drake escaped to nearby ships with the
                    town's women and children. But the towns defenders remained
                    and the survivors were imprisoned in a small windowless room
                    that came to be known as the Black Hole and 40 of 63
                    prisoners suffocated overnight. This story is mostly famous
                    because the British press exaggerated the numbers in order
                    to build support for the war in India.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>The Battle:</b> The arrival of a strong force under the
                    command of <b>Robert Clive</b> at Calcutta from Madras
                    strengthened the English position in Bengal. Clive forged a
                    secret alliance with <b>Mir Jafar</b>, husband of Alivardi
                    Khan’s sister. Under the deal, Mir Jafar was to be made the
                    nawab who in turn would reward the Company for its services.
                    Due to this conspiracy , the 50,000-strong force of Siraj
                    was defeated by a handful of Clive’s forces.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Significance of the Battle: </b>The Battle of Plassey
                    placed at the disposal of the English vast resources of
                    Bengal. After Plassey, the English virtually monopolised the
                    trade and commerce of Bengal. It laid the
                    <b>foundation of the British empire in India</b>. Their main
                    rivals, the French, were ousted.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <li>
                  Mir Jafar was increasingly irritated by the interference of
                  Clive. He entered into a <b>conspiracy with the Dutch</b> at
                  Chinsura (Hooghly). But the Dutch were defeated and humbled by
                  the English forces at Bedara/Chinsura/Hooghly.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The treachery of Mir Jafar and his failure to make the
                  payments due to the Company, annoyed the English. Under the
                  pressure of the Company, Mir Jafar decided to resign in favour
                  of <b>Mir Kasim/Qasim</b>, the son-in-law of Mir Jafar.
                </li>
                <li>
                  After assuming power, Mir Kasim shifted the capital
                  <b>from Murshidabad (West Bengal) to Munger in Bihar</b>.

                    goods specified from payment of duties) by Company officials
                    resulted in loss of tax revenue to the nawab. By an imperial
                    farman, the English company had obtained the right to trade
                    in Bengal without paying transit dues or tolls. However, the
                    servants of the Company also claimed the same privileges for
                    their private trade. The Company’s servants also sold dastak
                    to Indian merchants for a commission.

                    in 1764.

                  <li>
                    The war had been brought to an end by the
                    <b>Treaty of Allahabad in 1765</b>. Under this treaty, Shah
                    Alam II granted the East India Company <b>Diwani rights</b>,
                    or the right to collect taxes on behalf of the Emperor from
                    the eastern province of
                    <b>Bengal-Bihar-Orissa.</b>

                </ul>
                <li>
                  After the battle of Buxar, the East India Company became the
                  real masters of Bengal. Robert Clive introduced the
                  <b>dual system of government</b>, i.e., the rule of the
                  two—the Company and the Nawab—in Bengal in which both the
                  diwani, i.e., collecting revenues, and nizamat, i.e., police
                  and judicial functions, came under the control of the Company.
                  The system held a great advantage for the Company. It left the
                  appearance of authority to the puppet Indian ruler, while
                  keeping the sovereign power in the hands of the Company.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The dual system led to an administrative breakdown and proved
                  disastrous for the people of Bengal. Neither the Company nor
                  the Nawab cared for administration and public welfare. In
                  1770, Bengal suffered from a famine which is regarded as one
                  of the most terrible famines in human history. Warren Hastings
                  did away with the dual system in 1772.

              <h4>Cause of the War</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  After the death of Peshwa Madhavrao I in 1772, his brother
                  <b>Narayanrao</b>
                  became peshwa of the Maratha Empire.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Narayanrao was murdered by his palace guards in August 1773,
                  and his uncle <b>Raghunathrao</b> became Peshwa.
                </li>
                <li>
                  However, Narayanrao's wife, Gangabai, gave birth to a son, who
                  was the legal heir to the throne. The newborn infant was named
                  <b>'Sawai' Madhavrao</b>
                  .
                </li>
                <li>
                  Twelve Maratha chiefs, known as the <b>Baarbhai</b> led by
                  <b>Nana Phadnavis</b>, directed an effort to install the
                  infant as the new Peshwa and to rule in his name as regents.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Treaties of Surat</b>: Raghunathrao, unwilling to give up
                  his position in power, sought help from the English at Bombay
                  and signed the Treaty of Surat in 1775. Under the treaty,
                  Raghunathrao ceded the territories of Salsette and Bassein to
                  the English along with a portion of the revenues from Surat
                  and Bharuch districts. In return, the British promised to
                  provide Raghunathrao with 2,500 soldiers.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Treaty of Purandhar:</b> The British Calcutta Council, on
                  the other side of India, condemned the Treaty of Surat (1775)
                  and made a new treaty (Treaty of Purandhar, 1776) with the
                  regency renouncing Raghunath and promising him a pension. The
                  Bombay government rejected this and gave refuge to Raghunath.
                  In 1777, Nana Phadnavis violated his treaty with the Calcutta
                  Council by granting the French a port on the west coast. The
                  English retaliated by sending a force towards Pune.

                <li>
                  The Marathas utilised a <b>scorched earth policy</b>, burning
                  farmland and poisoning wells to cut off the English from food
                  and water supplies.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The English surrendered by mid-January 1779 and signed the
                  <b>Treaty of Wadgaon</b> that forced the Bombay government to
                  relinquish all territories acquired by the English since 1775.

                <li>
                  <b>Treaty of Salbai (1782):</b> Warren Hastings, the
                  Governor-General in Bengal, rejected the Treaty of Wadgaon and
                  sent a large force who captured Ahmedabad, Bassein, Gwalior
                  and defeated Sindhia. Sindhia proposed a new treaty between
                  the Peshwa and the English, and the Treaty of Salbai was
                  signed in May 1782; it was ratified by Hastings and Phadnavis.
                  The treaty guaranteed peace between the two sides for twenty
                  years.

                  A furious Yaswant Rao defeated the combined armies of Sindhia
                  and Bajirao II. Terrified Bajirao II fled to Bassein where, on
                  December 31, 1802, he signed a treaty with the English.

                  troops permanently in Maratha territory. The treaty would
                  become the "death knell of the Maratha Empire".

              <ul>
                <li>
                  The <b>Pindaris</b>, were a group of mercenaries attached to
                  Maratha armies. When the Marathas became weak, the Pindaris
                  could not get regular employment. As a consequence, they
                  started plundering neighbouring territories, including those
                  of the Company.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Lord Hasting's actions taken against the Pindaris were seen as
                  a transgression of the sovereignty of the Marathas; they
                  served to once again unite the Maratha confederacy.

                  <b>Bajirao II</b> made a last bid in 1817 by rallying together
                  the Maratha chiefs against the English in course of the Third

              <h4>The War</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The political and administrative conditions of all the Maratha
                  states were confused and inefficient. Though they won some
                  initial battles, the English won the war.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Maratha confederacy was dissolved. The peshwaship was
                  abolished.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In the end, it can be concluded that the English attacked a
                  ‘divided house’ which started crumbling after a few pushes.

              <div class="underline"></div>
              <h3>First Anglo-Sikh War (1845-46)</h3>
              <h4>Context</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The Sikh kingdom of Punjab was expanded and consolidated by
                  Maharajah <b>Ranjit Singh</b> during the early years of the
                  nineteenth century.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Ranjit Singh maintained a policy of wary friendship with the
                  British, ceding some territory south of the Sutlej River,
                  while at the same time building up his military forces both to
                  deter aggression by the British and to wage war against the
                  Afghans.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Sultej River acted as a line of demarcation between the Sikhs
                  and the English.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Ranjit Singh died in 1839. Almost immediately, his kingdom
                  began to fall into disorder.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Immediately after the death of Ranjit Singh, the British East
                  India Company had begun increasing its military strength in
                  the regions adjacent to the Punjab. Their main concern was
                  that the Sikh army, without strong leadership to restrain
                  them, was a serious threat to British territories along the
                  border. In 1843, the English conquered and annexed Sindh, to
                  the south of the Punjab.
                </li>
                <li>
                  An East India Company army began marching towards Ferozepur
                  (on the banks of the Sutlej River in Punjab). In response to
                  the British move, the Sikh army began crossing the Sutlej on
                  11 December 1845.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Sikhs claimed they were only moving into Sikh possessions
                  on the east side of the river, but the move was regarded by
                  the British as clearly hostile and they declared war.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Outcome of the war</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  In the end, sikhs were defeated by the British and the
                  <b>Treaty of Lahore</b> was signed between them.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Treaty of Lahore:</b> The valuable region (the Jullundur
                  Doab) between the Beas River and Sutlej River was surrendered
                  to the British. Gulab Singh, the ruler of Jammu, was allowed
                  to acquire entire Jammu and Kashmir from the Sikh Empire by a
                  large cash payment to the East India Company.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Treaty of Bhairowal</b>: The Sikhs were not satisfied with
                  the Treaty of Lahore over the issue of Kashmir, so they
                  rebelled. In December, 1846, the Treaty of Bhairowal was
                  signed.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Second Anglo-Sikh War (1848-49)</h3>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Although the Sikh Army was weakened by the first anglo-sikh
                  war, resentment at British interference in the government led
                  to the Second Anglo-Sikh War within three years.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Lord Dalhousie</b> himself proceeded to Punjab. Dalhousie
                  annexed Punjab. Sir John Lawrence became the first
                  Commissioner of Punjab.

                Extension of British Paramountcy Through Administrative Policy
              </h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The process of imperial expansion and consolidation of British
                  paramountcy was carried on by the Company during the 1757-1857
                  period through a two-fold method:
                </li>
                <ul style="list-style-type: square">
                  <li>policy of annexation by conquest or war and</li>
                  <li>
                    policy of annexation by diplomacy and administrative
                    mechanisms.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <li>
                  Major Indian powers like Bengal, Mysore, the Marathas and the
                  Sikhs were defeated and subjugated by the Company mainly by
                  waging wars against them.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In the case of many other powers, the British applied
                  diplomatic and administrative policies. In this context, we
                  may list following examples:
                </li>
                <ul style="list-style-type: square">
                  <li>Warren Hastings’ ‘ring-fence’ policy</li>
                  <li>Wellesley’s system of ‘subsidiary alliance’</li>
                  <li>Dalhousie’s ‘doctrine of lapse’</li>
                </ul>
              </ul>
              <h3>The Policy of Ring-Fence by Warren Hasting</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Lord Warren Hastings was the
                  <b>first ‘Governor General of Bengal’.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  He followed a policy of ring-fence which aimed at creating
                  buffer zones to defend the Company’s frontiers.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It was the policy of
                  <b
                    >defence of their neighbours’ frontiers for safeguarding
                    their own territories</b
                  >.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Thus the states brought under the ring-fence system were
                  assured of military assistance against external aggression—but
                  at their own expense. In other words, these allies were
                  required to maintain subsidiary forces which were to be
                  organised, equipped and commanded by the officers of the
                  Company who, in turn, were to be paid by the rulers of these
                  states.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Subsidiary alliance system by Lord Wellesley</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Lord Wellesley was governor-general from 1798-1805.</li>
                <li>
                  Wellesley’s policy of subsidiary alliance was an
                  <b>extension of the ring-fence system</b> which sought to
                  reduce the Indian states into a position of dependence on the
                  British government.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Under the system, the allying Indian state’s ruler was
                  compelled to:
                </li>
                <ul style="list-style-type: square">
                  <li>
                    accept the permanent stationing of a British force within
                    his territory and to pay a subsidy for its maintenance.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The Indian ruler had to agree to the posting of a British
                    resident in his court.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The Indian ruler could not employ any European in his
                    service without the prior consultation with the Company. Nor
                    could he go to war or negotiate with any other Indian ruler
                    without consulting the governor-general.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <li>
                  In return for all this, the British would defend the ruler
                  from his enemies and adopt a policy of non-interference in the
                  internal matters of the allied state.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The
                  <b>Indian rulers lost their independence by buying security</b
                  >. They were not free of interference from the British
                  Resident. They lost much of their revenue, paying for the
                  British troops. Also, the alliance made the Indian rulers weak
                  and irresponsible; the subjects were exploited and it was
                  practically impossible to depose the oppressive rulers as they
                  were protected by the British.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b> States which Accepted Alliance were:</b> the Nizam of
                  Hyderabad (1798), the ruler of Mysore (1799), the ruler of
                  Tanjore (1799), the Nawab of Awadh (1801), the Peshwa
                  (December 1801), the Bhonsle Raja of Berar (1803), the Sindhia
                  (1804), the Rajput states (1818). The Holkars were the last
                  Maratha confederation to accept the Subsidiary Alliance in
                  1818.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Doctrine of Lapse by Dalhousie</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The doctrine stated that the adopted son could be the heir to
                  his foster father’s private property, but not the state; it
                  was for the paramount power (the British) to decide whether to
                  bestow the state on the adopted son or to annex it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Though this policy is attributed to Lord Dalhousie (1848-56),
                  he was not its originator. But he was the one who showed too
                  much passion in enforcing the policy.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Annexed Lapsed States</b>: Satara (1848), <b>Jhansi</b>,
                  Awadh and Nagpur (1854). The other small states included
                  Jaitpur (Bundelkhand), Sambhalpur (Orissa), and Baghat (Madhya
                  Pradesh).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Dalhousie reign almost completed the process of expansion of
                  British power in India, which began with the victory over
                  Siraj-ud-daula at Plassey in 1757.
