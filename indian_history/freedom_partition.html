                Second World War (1939-1945) involved the vast majority of the
                world's countries—including all the great powers—forming two
                opposing military alliances: the Allies (UK, France, USA and the
                rest) and the Axis powers (Germany, Italy, Japan).

                  Congress agreed to support Britain only in return of
                  independence being granted. The viceroy could promise this
                  only after the war. In October-November 1939, the Congress
                  Ministries resigned in protest.

                <li>
                  The Muslim League, in contrast, supported Britain in the war
                  effort and maintained its control of the government in three
                  major provinces, Bengal, Sind and the Punjab.

                  <li>
                    Nehru recognised the imperialist nature of the war, but was
                    against taking advantage of Britain’s difficulties, even as
                    he was against Indian participation in the war.

                    The CWC resolved that no Indian participation unless freedom

                  <b>March 1940</b>: The Muslim League passed the
                  <b>"Lahore/Pakistan Resolution"</b>, demanding that, "the
                  areas in which the Muslims are numerically in majority as in
                  the North-Western and Eastern zones of India should be grouped
                  to constitute independent states in which the constituent

                <li>
                  The Congress was secular and strongly opposed to having any
                  religious state. It insisted there was a natural unity to
                  India, and repeatedly blamed the British for "divide and rule"
                  tactics based on prompting Muslims to think of themselves as

                  Jinnah rejected the notion of a united India, and emphasised

                  The Congress rejected the August Offer. Nehru said, “Dominion

                A mission under <b>Sir Stafford Cripps</b> was sent to India in
                march 1942. He proposed:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Dominion status to be granted after the war.</li>
                <li>
                  Constitution making body to be elected from provincial
                  assemblies and nominated by the rulers in case of princely
                  states.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Individual princes could sign a separate agreement with the
                  British.
                </li>
                <li>
                  British would however, control the defence for war period.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The British Government undertook to accept and implement the
                Constitution on two conditions:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  freedom to any province unwilling to join the Union to have a
                  separate agreement with Britain.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The new Constitution making body and the British Government
                  would negotiate a treaty to sort out matters arising out of
                  transfer of power to Indian hands.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p><b>The Congress objected to</b>—</p>

                <li>no immediate transfer of power</li>
                <li>retention of governor-general’s supremacy.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                Gandhi termed this proposal as a
                <b>post dated cheque in a crashing bank.</b>
              </p>
              <p>
                The Cripps Proposals were rejected by the Muslim League, which
                wanted India to be divided into two autonomous states with two
                separate Constituent Assemblies.

                  The All India Congress Committee met at Bombay on 8th August,
                  1942. It passed the famous Quit India resolution and proposed
                  to start off a
                  <b>non-violent mass struggle</b> under Gandhi’s leadership.

                  The merchant community and capilatist did not participate.
                  Muslim League kept aloof and the Hindu Mahasabha condemned the

                Meanwhile, efforts were on to solve the ongoing constitutional
                crisis, and some individuals also tried to come up with
                constitutional proposals. Rajagopalachari Formula was:

                Efforts continued to end the deadlock. Bhulabhai Desai, leader
                of the Congress Party in the Central Legislative Assembly, met
                Liaqat Ali Khan, deputy leader of the Muslim League in that
                Assembly, and both of them came up with the draft proposal for
                the formation of an interim government at the centre, consisting
                of—
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  an equal number of persons nominated by the Congress and the
                  League in the central legislature.
                </li>
                <li>20% of seats reserved for minorities.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                No settlement could be reached between the Congress and the

              </p>
              <h3>Wavell Plan (Shimla Conference—June 1945)</h3>
              <p>
                Although the war in Europe came to an end in May 1945, the
                Japanese threat still remained. The viceroy, Lord Wavell was
                permitted to start negotiations with Indian leaders. Congress
                leaders were released from jails in June 1945. Wavell plan
                included:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  With the exception of the governor-general and the
                  commander-in-chief, all members of the executive council were
                  to be Indians.
                </li>
                <li>Equal representation for Hindus and Muslims.</li>
                <li>
                  The governor-general was to exercise his veto on the advice of
                  ministers.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Jinnah demanded the Muslim League to have absolute choice in
                choosing the Muslim members, so he rejected the plan.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Congress objected to the plan as “an attempt to reduce the
                Congress to the status of a purely caste Hindu party and
                insisted on its right to include members of all communities
                among its nominees”.

              <h2>Subhash Chandra Bose and the Indian National Army (INA)</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The idea of Indian National Army (INA) was first conceived in
                  Malaya by
                  <b>Mohan Singh</b>, an Indian officer of the British Indian
                  Army.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Japanese handed over the Indian prisoners of war to Mohan
                  Singh, who tried to recruit them into an Indian National Army.
                  By the end of 1942, 40000 men were ready to join the INA. The
                  outbreak of the Quit India Movement gave a fillip to the INA.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In March, 1942, a conference of India was held in Tokyo and
                  <b>Indian Independence League</b> was formed. At
                  <b> Bangkok Conference, Ras Bihari Bose</b> was elected as
                  President of the league.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Subhash Chandra Bose was arrested in July 1940 when he
                  protested and tried to launch a satyagraha. He escaped from
                  India in 1941.He was reported to have approached Russia for
                  help in the Indian struggle for freedom from Britain. But, in
                  June 1941, Russia joined the Allies (England, America, France
                  etc.,) in the war, which disappointed Bose. He then went to
                  Berlin, Germany (axis power under Hitler).
                </li>
                <li>
                  He met Hitler under the pseudo name, <b>Orlando Mazzotta</b>.
                  With the help of Hitler, the <b>‘Freedom Army’</b> (Mukti
                  Sena) was formed which consisted of all the prisoners of war
                  of Indian origin captured by Germany and Italy. Dresden,
                  Germany was made the office of the Freedom Army. Bose came to
                  be called <b>‘Netaji’</b> by the people of Germany. He gave
                  the famous slogan, <b>‘Jai Hind’</b> from the Free India
                  Centre, Germany.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In 1943, he arrived at Singapore where he was assisted by Ras
                  Bihari Bose. In October, 1943, he set up a Provisional
                  Government for Free India with headquarters at Singapore and
                  later at Rangoon . The famous slogan—<b
                    >“Give me blood, I will give you freedom”</b
                  >
                  was given in Malaya.
                </li>
                <li>
                  On July 6, 1944, Subhas Bose addressed Mahatma Gandhi as
                  <b>‘Father of Nation’</b>—from the Azad Hind Radio (the first
                  person to call Gandhi, ‘Father of Nation’). He asked for
                  Gandhi’s blessings for “India’s last war of independence”.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The <b>Azad Hind Fauz</b> crossed the Burma border, and stood
                  on Indian soil on March 18, 1944. The INA units subsequently
                  advanced up to Kohima and Imphal. On April 14, the INA flag
                  was hoisted for the first time on the Indian mainland at
                  Moirang, in Manipur (where the INA Memorial Complex stands
                  today) to enthusiastic cries of “Jai Hind” and “Netaji
                  Zindabad”.
                </li>
                <li>
                  For three months the INA carried out military administration
                  duties at Moirang but then the Allied forces reclaimed the
                  territory. The INA met the same fate as the Japanese, and all
                  brigades began their withdrawal on July 18, 1944.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The steady Japanese retreat thereafter quashed any hopes of
                  the INA liberating the nation. The retreat continued till
                  mid-1945.
                </li>
                <li>
                  On August 15, 1945 the surrender of Japan in the Second World
                  War took place and with this the INA also surrendered.
                </li>
                <li>
                  On August 18, 1945, reportedly, Subhash Bose died mysteriously
                  in an air-crash at Taipei (Taiwan). But when the INA POWs were
                  brought back to India after the war to be court-martialled, a
                  powerful movement emerged in their defence. 12th November,
                  1945 was celebrated as INA Day.

              <h2>Independence of India</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                The British Government at England exhausted by the recently
                concluded World War II, and the increasingly restless British
                India, decided to end British rule of India, and in early 1947
                the British Prime Minister Clement Attlee made the following
                statement.
              </p>
              <h3>Attlee’s Statement ( 20th February, 1947)</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  A deadline of 30th June, 1948 was fixed for transfer of power,
                  even if the Indian politicians had not agreed by that time on
                  the Constitution.
                </li>
                <li>
                  British power and obligations vis-a-vis the princely states
                  would lapse with transfer of power.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Mountbatten</b> was to replace Wavell as the Viceroy.
                </li>
                <li>Partition of the country was inevitable.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                In June 1947, the nationalist leaders (of congress and the
                league) agreed to a partition of the country along religious
                lines in stark opposition to Gandhi's views.
              </p>
              <h3>Mountbatten Plan (3rd June, 1947)</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  As Viceroy, Mountbatten proved more decisive and quick in
                  taking decisions than his predecessors.
                </li>
                <li>
                  His task was to explore the option of unity or division till
                  October, 1947 and then advise the British Government on the
                  form of transfer of power.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>3rd June Plan</b>: In case of partition, two dominions and
                  two Constituent Assemblies would be created. The plan declared
                  that power would be handed over by 15th August, 1947.
                </li>
                <li>The referendum in NWFP decided in favour of Pakistan.</li>
                <li>
                  The Legislative Assemblies of Punjab and Bengal decided in
                  favour of partition of these two provinces. Thus, East Bengal
                  and West Punjab joined Pakistan. West Bengal and East Punjab
                  remained with India.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Indian Independence Act, 1947</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  On 18th July, 1947, British Parliament ratified the
                  Mountbatten Plan as the Independence of India Act, 1947.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The act provided for the creation of two independent dominions
                  of India and Pakistan. Each dominion was to have a
                  <b>Governor– General</b> to be responsible for effective
                  operation of the act.
                </li>
                <li>Sovereignity of British power was to be abolished.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>The Independence Day</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  On <b>15th August</b>, 1947, India got independence. India
                  requested Mountbatten to continue as the Governor-General of
                  India. Jinnah became the first Governor-General of Pakistan.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In particular, the partition of Punjab and Bengal led to
                  rioting between Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs in these provinces
                  and spread to other nearby regions, leaving some thousands
                  dead.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Assembly and Councils of the states were to be automatically
                  dissolved.
                </li>
                <li>
                  For the transitional period that is till a new Constituion was
                  adopted by each dominion, the government of the two dominion
                  were to be carried on in accordance with the
                  <b>Government of India Act, 1935</b> by the constituent
                  assembly itself.
