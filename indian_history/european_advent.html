              <h1 class="title">ADVENT OF EUROPEANS IN INDIA</h1>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  15th Century CE witnessed huge innovations in naval technology
                  which aided in ocean explorations for new trade routes. Hence
                  this period is referred to as the <b>'Age of Discovery'</b> .
                </li>

                <li>
                  In 1492, Christopher Columbus an Italian Explorer under the
                  sponsorship of a spain king, formulated a plan to seek a
                  western sea passage to the East Indies (Indonesian and
                  Philippine Archipelago), hoping to profit from the lucrative
                  spice trade. In the process he 'discovered' America.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Line of Demarcation</b>: A treaty was signed by Spain and
                  Portugal in 1494 called <b>Treaty of Tordesillas</b>, by which
                  they divided the whole globe into two halves. The lands to the
                  east of Cape Verde islands (off the west coast of Africa)
                  would belong to Portugal and lands to the west to Spain.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The closing of the traditional trade routes in western Asia by
                  the Ottoman Empire (Turkey), and rivalry with the Italian
                  states sent Portugal in search of an alternate sea route to
                  India.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Near the end of the 15th century, Portuguese sailor Vasco da
                  Gama became the first European to re-establish direct trade
                  links with India since Roman times by being the first to
                  arrive by circumnavigating Africa.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h2>The Portuguese in India</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Prince Henry the Navigator, a patron of sailors and a special
                  school at Sagres(Portugal) in which nautical knowledge was
                  collected and new maps were made. All that knowledge gave
                  Portuguese sailors a huge competitive advantage when it came
                  to exploration.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Vasco Da Gama</b> was the first of Henry’s protégés to
                  discover sea route to India in 1498. He reached port of
                  Calicut via <b>Cape of Good Hope</b> (S. Africa). At that time
                  Calicut was a major trading post on India’s west coast under
                  the Hindu ruler <b>Zamorin</b> (Samuthiri).
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Portuguese wanted to monopolise the hugely profitable
                  eastern trade by excluding competitors, especially the Arabs.
                  King Zamorin was against giving any special advantages to the
                  Portuguese. He was later defeated by the Portuguese.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Portuguese didn’t create huge colonies. However, they were
                  able to capture & control a number of coastal cities, creating
                  what historians call a <b>“trading post empire”</b>. Vasco’s
                  second visit in <b>1502</b> led to the establishment of
                  trading stations at <b>Calicut</b>, <b>Cochin</b> and
                  <b>Cannanore</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Francisco de Almeida (1505-09)</b> was the first Portuguese
                  Governor/Viceroy in India (three-year term). He initiated
                  <b>the blue water policy(cartaze system)</b>. Under which, the
                  Portuguese merchant ships would capture other ships and force
                  them to purchase a permit to trade called a <b>cartaze</b>.
                  And without a cartaze, a merchant couldn’t trade in any of the
                  towns that Portugal controlled.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Alfonso de Albuquerque (1509-1515)</b> became Governor of
                  the Portuguese in India in 1509. He captured Goa from Bijapur.
                  He initiated the policy of marrying with the natives of India
                  and banned the practice of sati in his area of influence.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Nino-da-Cunha (1529-1538)</b> transferred the capital from
                  Cochin to <b>Goa</b> in 1530. He aquired <b>Diu</b> from the
                  Gujarat King Bahadur Shah. They also acquired
                  <b>Hooghly(West Bengal)</b>
                  during this period.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Portuguese acquired <b>Daman</b> in 1559. They lost Hooghly
