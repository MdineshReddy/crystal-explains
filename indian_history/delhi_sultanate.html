              <p>
                Invasions by <b>Mahmud of Ghazni</b> and
                <b>Muhammad Ghori</b> into India ultimately resulted in the
                establishment of the Delhi Sultanate. Five different dynasties–
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>The Slave/Mamluk (1206–1290)</li>
                <li>The Khalji (1290–1320)</li>
                <li>The Tughlaq (1320–1414)</li>
                <li>The Sayyids (1414–1451)</li>
                <li>The Lodis (1451–1526)</li>
              </ol>
              <p></p>
              are collectively referred to as the Delhi Sultanate. The rulers,
              termed as
              <b>Sultans</b>, were of <b>Turkish</b> and <b>Afghan origin</b>.

              <h2>The Ilbari or Mamluk or Slave Dynasty(1206-1290 AD)</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  After Muhammad Ghori’s death, all the Muslim rulers who ruled
                  over India from <b>AD 1206-1290</b> were either
                  <b>slaves</b> or were descendants of the slave ruler. So, the
                  Dynasty is generally known as the
                  <b>Slave Dynasty.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>‘Mamluk’</b> was the Arabic word meaning <b>‘owned’</b>,
                  used to refer slaves, who were used as domestic labour or
                  artisans.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The dynasty is also called <b>Ilbari Dynasty</b>, as all the
                  rulers of this dynasty <b>except Aibak</b> belonged to the
                  <b>Ilbari tribe of Turks</b>.
                </li>
                <li>Three dynasties were established during this period.</li>
                <ul style="list-style-type: square">
                  <li>
                    <b>Qutbi dynasty (c.1206–1211 CE)</b> founded by Qutubuddin
                    Aibak.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>First Ilbari dynasty (c.1211–1266 CE)</b> founded by
                    Iltutmish.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Second Ilbari dynasty (c.1266–1290 CE)</b> founded by

                </ul>
              </ul>
              <h3>Qutubuddin Aibak (1206–10)</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Originally a <b>turkish slave</b>, Qutubuddin, because of his
                  merit and loyal service rose to the post of Governor (of
                  Ghori’s Indian possessions) by Muhammad Ghori. After Ghori’s
                  death, Aibak became the ruler of north India and founded the
                  Slave dynasty.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He assumed the title of <b>‘Sultan’</b> and made
                  <b>Lahore</b> his capital.
                </li>
                <li>
                  For his generosity, he was given the title of
                  <b>Lakh Baksh.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  He sponsered the construction of the mosque –
                  <b>Quwwat-ul-Islam (Delhi).</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  He started construction of the <b>Qutub Minar</b> (only the
                  first Storey) in the memory of the famous Sufi saint,
                  <b>Khwaja Qutbuddin Bakthiyar Kaki</b> (it was later completed
                  by <b> Iltutmish</b>).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Aibak died suddenly in c.1210 CE, while playing
                  <b>Chaugan (horse polo)</b>.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <br />
              <p>
                <b>Aram Shah (AD 1210):</b>After Qutubuddin’s death, his son
                Aram Shah succeeded him. Aram Shah proved quite incompetent.
                Some of the nobles rose to the occasion and invited
                <b>Aibak’s son-in-law Iltutmish</b> to ascend the throne. He
                deposed Aram Shah and secured the throne for himself.

              <h3>Shamsuddin Iltutmish (1210–1236 AD)</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The real consolidator of Turkish rule in India. He belonged to
                  the
                  <b>Ilbari tribe</b> and hence his dynasty is also known as the
                  Ilbari dynasty. After becoming Sultan, he shifted his capital
                  from Lahore to <b> Delhi</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  During his period, <b>the Mongols</b> under their leader
                  <b>Genghis Khan</b>, made their appearance for the first time
                  in Indian Subcontinent. He saved Delhi Sultanate from the
                  wrath of Genghis Khan by refusing shelter to Jalaluddin
                  Mingburnu (the Khwarazmian ruler of Afghanistan), whom Genghis
                  Khan was chasing.
                </li>

                <li>
                  He completed the construction of the
                  <b>Qutab Minar at Delhi</b>. He is considered as the
                  <b>father of Tomb Building</b>. (built <b>Sultan Garhi</b> in
                  Delhi, the first Islamic Mausoleum built in 1231 AD for the
                  eldest son of Iltumish).
                </li>
                <li>
                  He patronized <b>Minhas-us-Siraj</b> who wrote
                  <b>Tahaqat-i-Nasiri,</b> an elaborate history of the Islamic
                  world written in Persian.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Since he did not consider any of his sons worthy of the
                  throne, he declared his daughter <b>Razia as successor</b>,
                  deviating from normal practice.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Iltumish's Administration</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Iltutmish organized the administration of the Sultanate,
                  laying the foundation for its dominance over northern India
                  until the Mughal invasion.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He introduced the arabic coinage of silver tanka and the
                  copper jital - the two basic coins of the Sultanate period.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>Iqtadari System</b>: He divided his empire into Iqtas
                  (assignment of land in lieu of salary). Every Iqtadars had to
                  maintain law and order and collect revenue. After deducting
                  own salary and expenses, they had to send the surplus to
                  central government. As a matter of fact, the Iqtadars were
                  transferable.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He organized <b>turkan-i-chahalgani or Chalissa</b>, a new
                  class of ruling elite of forty powerful military leaders,
                  <b>the Forty</b>. These were Turkish amirs (nobles) who
                  advised and helped the Sultan in administering the Sultanate.
                  After the death of Iltutmish, this group assumed great power
                  in its hands. For a few years they decided on the selection of
                  Sultans one after the other. The group was finally eliminated
                  by <b>Balban.</b>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Razia Sultana (1236–1240 AD)</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Iltutmish was succeeded by Razia's half-brother
                  <b>Ruknuddin Firuz</b> , whose mother Shah Turkan planned to
                  execute her. During a rebellion against Ruknuddin, Razia
                  instigated the general public against Shah Turkan, and
                  ascended the throne after Ruknuddin was deposed in 1236.
                </li>
                <li>
                  She was the <b>first</b> and
                  <b>only female Muslim ruler</b> of medieval India.
                </li>
                <li>
                  She discarded female apparel and purdah; she held court with
                  her face unveiled. She started appearing in public dressed in
                  traditional male attire and rode on elephants through the
                  streets of Delhi, making public appearances like the earlier
                  Sultans.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Turkic nobles who supported her, expected her to be a
                  figurehead, but she increasingly asserted her power.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Her recruitment of a few
                  <b>non-Turks to important posts</b> invited the wrath of the
                  Turkish amirs. Particularly the appointment of a non-Turk,
                  <b>Yakut</b> to the high office led to opposition.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The nobles conspired against her and made <b>Altunia</b>,
                  Governor of Bhatinda / Tabarhinda (Punjab) rebel. Razia,
                  accompanied by Yakut, marched against Altunia. At Tabarhinda,
                  the rebel forces killed her loyalist Yaqut, and imprisoned
                  her.
                </li>
                <li>
                  After deposing Razia, the nobles at Delhi had distributed
                  important offices and iqtas among themselves, ignoring claims
                  of Altunia, who had arrested Razia at Tabarhinda. Altunia lost
                  all hope of realizing any benefits from Razia's overthrow, and
                  decided to ally with her. Razia also saw this as an
                  opportunity to win back the throne, and married Altunia in
                  September 1240.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Altunia assembled an army. In September–October 1240, Sultan
                  <b> Muizuddin Bahram</b> (another son of Iltumish) led an army
                  against the forces of Altunia and Razia, and defeated them on
                  14 October 1240. Altunia and Razia were forced to retreat to
                  Kaithal (haryana), where they were killed.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <br />
              <p>
                After Raziya, the battle of succession continued with puppet
                rulers while the real power was exercised by the Chahalgani
                /Chalissa / The forty.
              </p>
              <h3>Ghiyasuddin Balban (1265–1286 AD)</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Balban ascended the throne in 1265, after killing all members
                  of Iltutmish’s family. He himself was a
                  <b>member of the chalissa</b> or chahalgani (the forty).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Balban knew that the real threat to the monarchy was from the
                  nobles called <b>the Forty</b>. He was convinced that only by
                  enhancing the power and authority of the monarchy he could
                  solve this problem. So he broke the power of chahalgani and
                  restored the prestige of the crown.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He declared the Sultan as, the
                  <b>‘representative of God on the Earth’</b>. He took up the
                  title of <b>Zil-i-Ilahi (Shadow of God)</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Balban introduced rigorous court discipline and new customs
                  such as
                  <b>sijada</b> (prostration, kneeling and touching the ground)
                  and
                  <b>paibos</b>
                  (kissing the Sultan’s feet) to prove his superiority over the
                  nobles. He refused to laugh and joke in the court, and even
                  gave up drinking wine so that no one may see him in a
                  non-serious mood.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He introduced the Persian festival of <b>Nauroz</b> (meaning
                  New year).
                </li>
                <li>
                  He organized a strong centralized army, both to deal with
                  internal disturbances, and to repel the Mongols who had
                  entrenched themselves in the Punjab and posed a serious threat
                  to the Delhi Sultanate.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He separated the <b>Diwan-i-wazarat</b> (Finance Department)
                  from the
                  <b>Diwan-i-Arz</b>
                  (Military Department).
                </li>
                <li>
                  He followed the policy of <b>Blood and Iron</b>.This policy
                  implied being ruthless to the enemies. He administered justice
                  with extreme impartiality.

                <li>
                  He was a patron of Persian literature, and showed special

              <div class="underline"></div>
              The Khaljis were of Turko-Afghan origin. A group of Khalji nobles
              led by
              <b>Jalaluddin Khalji</b>, overthrew the incompetent successors of
              Balban in 1290 AD. The Khalji rebellion was welcomed by the
              non-Turkish nobility. The Khaljis did not exclude the Turks from
              high offices, but <b>ended the Turkish monopoly</b>.
              <h3>Jalaluddin Khalji (1290-1296 AD)</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Jalaluddin Khalji laid the foundation of the Khalji dynasty.
                  He was 70 years old when he came to power and ruled only for a
                  short span of six years. He was known as a mild-mannered,
                  humble and kind monarch to the general public (including
                  hindus).
                </li>
                <li>
                  He avoided harsh punishments. Jalaluddin tried to win the
                  goodwill of the nobility by adopting
                  <b> policy of tolerance</b>.

                  During his reign in c.1294 CE, Devagiri/Deogiri (Daulatabad,

                </li>
                <li>
                  In 1296 CE, Alauddin Khalji treacherously murdered his
                  father-in-law Jalaluddin Khalji and usurped the throne of
                  Delhi. He proclaimed himself Sultan by winning over the nobles
                  and soldiers to his side by lavish use of gold (accumulated
                  from Devagiri).

              <ul>
                <li>
                  He came to the throne by treacherously murdering his uncle and

                </li>
                <li>
                  Jalaluddin’s <b>policy of tolerance was reversed</b> by
                  Alauddin Khalji, who awarded drastic punishments to all those
                  who dared to oppose him. He massacred the rebellious nobles,
                  relatives, family members and the Mongols who had settled in
                  Delhi. Alauddin gave harsh punishment even to the wives and
                  children of all nobles.
                </li>
                <li>
                  According to <b>Barani</b>, the author of
                  <b>Tarikh-i-Firuz Shahi</b>, Alauddin was convinced that the
                  general prosperity of the nobles, inter-marriages between
                  noble families, inefficient spy-system, and drinking liquor,
                  were the basic reasons for the rebellions. Therefore, he laid
                  four rules:
                </li>
                <ul style="list-style-type: square">
                  <li>He confiscated the properties of the nobles.</li>
                  <li>
                    The intelligence system was reorganized and all the secret
                    activities of the nobles were immediately reported to the
                    Sultan.
                  </li>
                  <li>The use of liquor and intoxicants was prohibited.</li>
                  <li>
                    Social gatherings, inter-noble marriages and festivities
                    without the permission of Sultan were forbidden.

                  <b>Ranthambore:</b> reputed to be the strongest fort of
                  Rajasthan and had earlier defied Jalaluddin Khalji. In c. 1301
                  CE, the fort fell to Alauddin. Women committed jauhar or
                  self-immolation (described by <b>Amir Khusrau</b>).

                <li>
                  <b>Chittor:</b> In c. 1303 CE, Alauddin besieged Chittor,
                  another powerful state of Rajputana. According to some
                  scholars, Alauddin attacked Chittor because he coveted
                  <b>Padmini</b>, the beautiful queen of
                  <b>Raja Ratan Singh</b>. The Rajput women including Rani
                  Padmini performed jauhar. This Padmini episode was graphically
                  mentioned in the book <b>Padmavath</b>, written by
                  <b>Jayasi</b>. According to Amir Khusrau, the Sultan ordered a
                  general massacre of the civil population.

                  This region was ruled by four important dynasties – Yadavas of
                  Devagiri, Kakatiyas of Warangal, Hoysalas of Dwarasamudra, and
                  the Pandyas of Madurai.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Malik Kafur captured Devagiri and Warangal, overthrew the
                  Hoysala Empire south of the Krishna River and raided Madurai
                  in Tamil Nadu. He then looted the treasury in capitals and
                  from the temples of south India. Among these loots was the
                  Warangal loot that included the
                  <b>Koh-i-Noor</b> .
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Administration of Alauddin</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Alauddin maintained a large standing army. He managed to raise
                  such a large army by paying relatively low salaries to his
                  soldiers, and introduced market price controls to ensure that
                  the low salaries were acceptable to his soldiers.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He paid soldiers in cash. Although he was opposed to granting
                  lands to his generals and soldiers, he generously rewarded
                  them after successful campaigns, especially those in Deccan.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He was the first Turkish sultan who separated religion from
                  politics. He proclaimed <b>kingship knows no kinship</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He introduced <b> Chehra and Dagh System</b> wherein the
                  Chehra (detailed description of each soldier) and Dagh
                  (branding of horses) was maintained.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Alauddin constructed the <b>Alai Darwaja</b>, the entrance
                  gate of the Qutub Minar. He also built the palace of thousand
                  pillars called <b>‘Hazar Situn’</b> in Delhi. He built his
                  capital at <b>Siri</b> in Delhi.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Market/Economic Reforms</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Alauddin controlled the market by many regulations. He fixed
                  the cost of all commodities.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The supply of grain was ensured by holding stocks in
                  government store houses. No hoarding was allowed and even
                  during the famine the same price was maintained.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The sale of liquor and intoxicants was prohibited and gambling
                  too was banned.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He established the market control department called
                  <b>Diwani Riyasat</b>. Every merchant was registered under the
                  Market Department.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Alauddin brought a large tract of fertile land under the
                  directly-governed crown territory, by eliminating iqta's, land
                  grants and vassals especially in the Ganga-Yamuna Doab region.

                <li>
                  He died due to the collapse of a wooden structure; some
                  scholars like
                  <b>Ibn Batuta</b> (Moroccan Traveller) believe that his death

                  Ghiyasuddin sent the young Muhammad to the Deccan to campaign
                  against king Prataparudra of the Kakatiya dynasty whose
                  capital was at Warangal in 1321 and 1323. Muhammad ascended to

                    Gangas and the Yamuna by increasing the rate of taxation.
                    This measure proved to be ill-timed as the Doab was passing

                    Deogiri as <b>Daulatabad</b>. But the capital shifted back
                    to Delhi after two years because of the lack of water supply
                    in Daulatabad. This arduous journey claimed the life of many

                    the silver coin which would have the same value. Very few
                    people exchanged gold/silver for copper and the tokens were
                    easy to forge, which lead to heavy losses.

                <li>
                  He strictly followed the advice of the ulemas in running the

                  <b>Jaziya</b> was strictly imposed on non-Muslims. He treated

                  His successor was Mubarak Khan, who renamed himself Mubarak
                  Shah and unsuccessfully tried to regain lost territories in

              <h2>Lodhi Dynasty (1451-1526 AD)</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                The Lodhis were the last ruling family of the Sultanate period
                and the first to be headed by the complete <b>Afghans</b> who
                were ruling over <b>Sirhind (Punjab)</b> when the Sayyids were
                in India.
              </p>
              <h3>Bahlol Lodhi (1451–89 AD)</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  With the help of a few nobles, Bahlol Lodhi took charge of the
                  army, and became the Sultan. Thus, he laid the foundation of
                  Lodhi dynasty.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Bahlul did much to stop rebellions and uprisings in his
                  territories, and extended his holdings over Gwalior (MP),
                  Jaunpur(UP) and upper Uttar Pradesh.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Sikander Lodhi (1489–1517 AD)</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>His real name was <b>Nizam Khan</b>.</li>
                <li>
                  He was a good administrator. Roads were laid and many
                  irrigational facilities were provided for the benefit of the
                  peasantry. He laid great emphasis on justice.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Despite certain laudable qualities, he was a bigot and showed
                  little tolerance towards the non-Muslims. He destroyed many
                  Hindu temples and imposed many restrictions on the Hindus.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He also moved his capital and court from Delhi to <b>Agra</b>.
                  The growth of Agra continued during the Mughal Empire, after
                  the end of the Delhi Sultanate.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Ibrahim Lodhi (1517–1526 AD)</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  He was the eldest son of Sikander Lodhi, who was not only
                  <b>arrogant</b> but a
                  <b>repressive</b>
                  ruler too.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Ibrahim did not enjoy the support of Afghan and Persian nobles
                  or regional chiefs. He openly insulted and humiliated his
                  nobles in court and put to death those nobles who revolted
                  against him.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Daulat Khan Lodhi</b>, the governor of the Punjab, greatly
                  displeased by the arrogance and insult of Ibrahim,
                  <b>invited Babur to invade India</b>. 
                </li>
                <li>
                  Babur marched against Delhi and defeated and killed Ibrahim
                  Lodhi in the
                  <b>first Battle of Panipat (c.1526 CE)</b> in Haryana. The
                  Afghan kingdom thus lasted for only seventy-five years.

                </li>
                <li>
                  The post of <b>Naib</b> was the most powerful one. The Naib
                  practically enjoyed all the powers of the Sultan and exercised
                  general control over all the departments.
                </li>

                  affairs, which dealt with pious foundations and gave stipends
                  to deserving scholars and man of piety. It was headed by chief
