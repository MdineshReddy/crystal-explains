              <h1 class="title">THE MUGHALS</h1>
              <h2>Babur (1526–30)</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Babur founded the Mughal Empire. He was a Central Asian ruler
                  who claimed lineage from <b>Timur</b> (the founder of the
                  Timurid Empire) on his father’s side and from <b>Chagatai</b>,
                  the second son of the Mongol ruler Genghis Khan, on his
                  mother’s side. Due to the lineage of Timur, the Mughals are
                  also referred as <b>Timurids.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  He originally ruled over <b>Ferghana (Afghanistan)</b>. The
                  unstable political situation in India after Sikandar Lodhi’s
                  death aided in his entry.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It is believed that he was invited to fight against
                  <b>Ibrahim Lodhi</b> by <b>Daulat Khan Lodhi</b> (Governor of
                  Punjab), <b>Alam Khan</b> (uncle of Ibrahim Lodhi), and
                  <b>Rana Sanga of Mewar</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>The First Battle of Panipat (c.1526 CE):</b> This was one
                  of the decisive battles of Indian history, fought between
                  Ibrahim Lodhi and Babur. Ibrahim Lodhi was defeated and Babur
                  was able to take control of Delhi and Agra.
                </li>
                <li>
                  His victory led to rapid popularisation of gunpowder and
                  artillery in India.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Babur occupied Delhi and sent his son Humayun to seize Agra.
                  Babur proclaimed himself as the <b>“Emperor of Hindustan”.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  He defeated Rana Sanga of Mewar in <b>Battle of Khanwa</b> in
                  1527. Babur took the title of ‘Ghazi’ after this.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In <b>Battle of Chanderi</b> (1528), he defeated Medini Rai,
                  the Rajput ruler of Malwa.
                </li>

                <li>
                  He was deeply learned in Persian, Arabic and Turkish. He wrote
                  his memoir in Turki called <b>Tuzuk-i-Babri/Babarnama</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He introduced <b>Char-Baghs</b>, symmetrically laid out
                  gardens with running waters and fountains.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He died in AD 1530 and was buried at <b>Aram Bagh in Agra</b>.
                  Later his body was taken to <b>Aram Bagh at Kabul.</b>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h2>Humayun (1530-40 and 1555-56)</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <ul>
                <li>He was the son of Babur and Maham Anaga begum.</li>
                <li>
                  Unlike most monarchies, which practised primogeniture, the
                  Timurids followed the example of Genghis and did not leave an
                  entire kingdom to the eldest son. Hence Babur had divided his
                  empire among the three brothers of Humayun.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Humayun had to face difficulties from his brothers to ascend
                  to the throne.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He also had to confront the hostility of the Afghans and other
                  prominent provincial rulers as they were not fully subdued.
                  This included
                  <b>Sher Khan</b>, a powerful Afghan of Bihar, and the
                  provincial ruler of Gujarat, <b>Bahadur Shah</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Battle of Chausa (near Buxar, c.1539 CE):</b> Humayun was
                  defeated by <b>Sher Khan</b> who adopted the title of
                  <b>Sher Shah Suri</b>. Humayun escaped to Agra, then to Sindh.
                </li>
                <ul style="list-style-type: square">
                  <li>
                    The <b>Sur Empire</b> (1540–1555), founded by Sher Shah
                    Suri, briefly interrupted Mughal rule. Shershah was an able
                    ruler. He improved the transportation by building roads. He
                    built Purana Qila in Delhi, along with Grand-Trunk road. He
                    introduced siver rupiya.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <li>
                  Humayun wandered about in Sindh (c.1540 CE) and its
                  neighboring regions trying different schemes to regain his
                  kingdom. While staying at Amarkot, a Hindu kingdom ruled by
                  Rana Prasad Rao, Humayun's wife <b>Hamida Banu Begum</b> gave
                  birth to <b>Akbar</b>(c.1542 CE).

                  Ultimately, Humayun sought shelter at the court of the Persian
                  king (of Safavid Empire) who forced him to convert to Shia
                  faith (Mughals were otherwise Sunni), and recaptured Gandhar
                  and Kabul with his help in c. 1545 CE.

                  Humayun defeated the Afghans and recovered the Mughal throne.
                  <b>Bairam Khan</b>, one of his faithful officers, led his army

                  at Sher Mandal at Delhi in c.1556 CE. For him, it is said that

                  not conceded, he stabbed the acting wazir in his office.

                    The climax of fort-building reached during the reign of Shah
                    Jahan. The famous <b>Red Fort</b> at Delhi was his creation.

                  <li>
                    He also build <b>the Peacock Throne</b> (Takht-i-Taus) , on

                <li>
                  Shah Jahan also patronized many writers and historians like

                  Shah Jahan’s sudden illness in c.1657 CE plunged the empire
                  into a civil war (c.1657–59 CE) among his four sons.
                  <b>Aurangzeb</b> emerged victorious in this struggle.

                  Aurangzeb made Shah Jahan prisoner in Agra Fort. But he was
                  not ill-treated. Shah Jahan lived for eight long years nursed
                  by his daughter <b>Jahanara</b>. He died in c.1666 CE and was
                  buried beside his wife’s grave in the Taj Mahal.

              <div class="underline"></div>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Under him, the Mughal empire reached its greatest extent and
                  the largest single state ever known in India.
                </li>

                <li>
                  His religious policy was a departure from the policy of
                  tolerance and universal peace followed by Akbar.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He <b>reimposed Jaziya</b>. The Hindu Mansabdar, however,
                  maintained their high proportions during his rule.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Aurangzeb’s rule can be broadly divided into two periods, in
                  the first 23 years, he concentrated in the North, when Maratha
                  power under Shivaji <b>emerged</b> and the second period
                  (1682-1707) is marked by his pre-occupations with the affairs
                  of Deccan.

                <li>
                  <b> Marathas under Shivaji</b>: Shivaji was a powerful king.
                  Aurangzeb conspired with Jai Singh of Amber against Shivaji in
                  1665. Shivaji visited Mughal court on the request of Jai
                  Singh, but was imprisoned. He managed to escape in 1674 and
                  declared himself an independent monarch. After his death in
                  1680, his son and successor, Sambhaji was executed by
                  Aurangzeb in 1689. Later Marathas continued the movement
                  against the Mughals.

                  <b>Against Sikhs:</b>
                  In 1675, he ordered the arrest and execution of the ninth Sikh
                  Guru,
                  <b>Guru Tegh Bhadur</b>. Against this, Guru Gobind Singh
                  organized his followers into a military force called Khalsa,
                  but he was also murdered in AD 1708 by an Afghan in Deccan.
                  Later, Banda Bairagi continued the war against Mughals.

                <li>
                  Aurangzeb died in AD 1707 and was buried at Khuldabad

                With the death of Aurangabad, the Mughal empire declined rapidly
                with incapable rulers. Although the empire continued till 1857,
                it remained
                <b>a shadow of its former self</b> and was never able to attain
                the glory, it once enjoyed.
