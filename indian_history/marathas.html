              <h1 class="title">The Marathas</h1>
              <p>
                The Maratha Empire and later the Maratha Confederacy dominated a
                large portion of the Indian subcontinent in the 18th century.
                The empire formally existed from 1674 with the coronation of
                Shivaji as the Chhatrapati and ended in 1818 with the defeat of
                Peshwa Bajirao II at the hands of the British East India
                Company.
              </p>
              <h2>Shivaji (1674-80)</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Shivaji was born in 1630 in the hill-fort of Shivneri, near
                  the city of Junnar in what is now Pune district.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He belonged to the Bhonsle Clan of Marathas. Shivaji’s father
                  <b>Shahji Bhonsle</b> was a military commander under Deccan
                  Sultanates (Nizamshahi of Ahmadnagar and Adilshahi of Bijapur)
                  and was given jagir of Pune. His mother was <b>Jijabhai</b> .
                </li>
                <li>
                  He started his career as an young prince at Poona after
                  inheriting the jagir of Poona from his father in 1937.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He created an independent Maratha kingdom with
                  <b>Raigad</b> (Maharashtra) as its capital where he built the
                  <b>Raigad Fort</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In c.1664 CE, Shivaji sacked the rich port of <b>Surat</b>.
                  This plundering of Surat, an important Mughal trading city,
                  enraged Aurangzeb and he sent Raja Jai Singh of Amber and
                  Diler Khan to destroy the Maratha power. Shivaji opened
                  negotiations with Jai Singh and the
                  <b>Treaty of Purander</b> was signed in c.1665 CE by which he
                  surrendered some forts.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It is believed that, in c.1665 CE, Shivaji visited Agra with
                  his son but were humiliated by Aurangzeb who put them under
                  house arrest. Shivaji escaped along with his son .
                </li>
                <li>
                  He defeated Mughals in the <b>Battle of Salher</b> (c.1672
                  CE). This battle is considered particularly significant as it
                  is the first battle in which the Mughal Empire lost to the
                  Marathas.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He was crowned as <b>Chhatrapati</b> (sovereign) of the new
                  Maratha kingdom in 1674.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Towards end of c.1676 CE, Shivaji launched a wave of conquests
                  in southern India’s Carnatic region and captured the forts of
                  <b>Vellore</b> and <b>Ginjee</b> , which served as the
                  Maratha’s capital for nine years.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He died due to fever in c.1680 CE, at the age of 53, after
                  ruling for only six years. In this short time he founded the
                  Maratha kingdom, which dominated western India for a century
                  and a half.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Shivaji promoted Sanskrit, but
                  <b>respected all religions and opposed forced conversion</b>.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Marathas After Shivaji</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                Shivaji had two sons: Sambhaji and Rajaram, who had different
                mothers and were half-brothers.
              </p>
              <h3>Sambhaji (1681-89)</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  In 1681, Sambhaji succeeded to the crown after his father's
                  death and resumed his expansionist policies.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In 1681, <b>Prince Akbar</b>, the rebellious son of Aurangzeb
                  took shelter with him. Which prompted Aurangzeb heading south
                  in 1681.
                </li>
                <li>
                  During the eight years that followed, Sambhaji led the
                  Marathas, never losing any of the battles or forts to
                  Aurangzeb.

                <li>
                  The infant son of Sambhaji,
                  <b>Shahu</b>, was taken captive by Aurangzeb. Sambhaji was
                  succeeded by his half-brother Rajaram in 1689.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  His eleven-year reign was marked with a constant struggle
                  against the Mughals.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He died of lung disease in 1700 at Sinhagad near Pune. His
                  widow
                  <b>Tarabai</b> put her infant son, <b>Shivaji II</b>, on the

                </li>
              </ul>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  After Aurangzeb’s death in 1707, Shahu, the grandson of
                  Shivaji and son of Sambhaji was released by Bahadur Shah I,
                  the new Mughal emperor.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He claimed the throne and this led to a civil war between
                  Shahu and Tarabai.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Shahu emerged victorious in the <b>Battle of Khed</b>, with
                  the help of
                  <b>Balaji Vishwanath.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  After this, <b>Shahu ruled from Satara</b> and
                  <b>Tarabai from Kolhapur</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  From now onwards, the rule of Peshwa (Prime ministers)
                  started. They became de facto rulers of the Maratha empire.

              </ul>
              <h3>The Peshwas (AD 1713–1818)</h3>
              <h4>Balaji Viswanath (1713–1720)</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  He excelled in diplomacy and won over many Maratha chiefs to
                  the side of Shahu. He made the Peshwa post as the functional
                  head of the Maratha empire.
                </li>

                <li>
                  He helped Sayyid brothers in over throwing the Mughal emperor
                  (Farrukhsiyar).
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Baji Rao I (1720-1740)</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  He was a bold and brilliant commander and was considered the
                  greatest expert in guerilla tactics after Shivaji. Maratha
                  power reached its zenith under him.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Marathas defeated the Nizam in 1728. The battle is
                  considered an example of brilliant execution of military
                  strategy.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Under his leadership, the Marathas compelled the Mughals first
                  to give them the <b>right to collect chauth</b> of the vast
                  areas and then to cede those areas to the Maratha kingdom.

              </ul>
              <h4>Balaji Baji Rao (Nana Sahib) (1740-1761)</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  In an agreement with the Mughal emperor (Ahmed Shah), the
                  Peshwa agreed to protect the Mughal empire from internal and
                  external enemies in return for the chauth.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In the <b>Third Battle of Panipat</b> in 1761, between Maratha
                  and Ahmed Shah Abdali, <b>Viswas Rao</b>, the son of Nana
                  Sahib died.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Peshwa Madhav Rao I (1761-1772)</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Balaji Baji Rao was succeded by his younger son Madhav Rao I.
                </li>
                <li>
                  After the death of Madhav Rao,
                  <b>Peshwaship had lost all its power.</b> The Maratha Empire
                  became a confederacy of many semi-autonomous Maratha states.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <br />
              <p>
                The Marathas remained a major power in India until their defeat
                in the

                >
                (1805–1818), which resulted in the East India Company
                controlling most of India.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  The Marathas used a secular policy of administration and
                  allowed complete freedom of religion.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Several majestic palaces were built by Maratha principalities
