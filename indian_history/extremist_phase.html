              <p>
                The period from 1905 to 1920 in the Indian National movement was
                known as extremist phase as this period was dominated by the
                extremists or the aggressive nationalists who believed that
                success could be achieved through any means.
              </p>
              <h2>Cause for the Rise of Extremists</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The failure of Moderates to achieve any substantial outcome
                  and dissatisfaction with their methods.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Growing consciousness about the exploitative character of the
                  British rule.

                    Calcutta Corporation Act (1899), which reduced the strength
                    of elected members from India, thereby giving British a
                    majority.

                  <li>

              <h2>Ideology and Methods of the Extremists</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <h3>Ideology</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Hatred for foreign rule</li>
                <li>They believed in the capacity of the masses</li>
                <li>
                  Swarajya as goal. Unlike the Moderates, the Extremists had no
                  faith in the British. They wanted complete independence and
                  not just self-government.
                </li>
                <li>
                  They advocated direct political action and self-sacrifice.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Methods</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Promotion of Swadeshi goods and Boycott of foreign goods.
                </li>
                <li>Non Co-operation with Britishers (Passive Resistance).</li>
              </ul>
              <h2>Extremist Leaders</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <h3>Lala Lajpat Rai (1865-1928)</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  referred to as the <b>Punjab Kesari</b> (The Lion of Punjab)
                </li>
                <li>
                  He was a veteran leader of the Indian Nationalist Movement,
                  Indian independence movement led by the Indian National
                  Congress, Hindu reform movements and Arya Samaj.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He cofounded the Punjab National Bank (1894) as a part of the
                  Swadeshi movement.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He led a peaceful protest march against the all-British Simon
                  Commission in 1928. The police superintendent in Lahore, James
                  A. Scott, ordered the police to lathi charge the protesters
                  and personally assaulted Rai.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Despite being severely injured, Rai subsequently addressed the
                  crowd and said
                  <i>
                    "I declare that the blows struck at me today will be the
                    last nails in the coffin of British rule in India"</i
                  >. He did not fully recover from his injuries and died on 17
                  November 1928.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Bhagat Singh</b> who was a witness to the event, swore to
                  avenge the death of Rai, who was a significant leader of the
                  Indian independence movement.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Bal Gangadhar Tilak (1856-1920)</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  referred to as <b>Lokmanya Tilak</b>, he was from Bombay.
                  Lokmanya means "accepted by the people (as their leader)",
                </li>

              <h2>Bengal Partition and the Swadeshi Movement</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Through a royal proclamation, <b>Lord Curzon</b> ordered
                  Partition of Bengal on <b>16th October, 1905.</b> The idea was
                  to have two provinces:
                </li>
                <ul style="list-style-type: square">
                  <li>
                    Hindu-majority province of Western Bengal including the
                    provinces of Bihar and Orissa
                  </li>
                  <li>Muslim-majority province of Eastern Bengal and Assam.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>
                  The British said that the existing province of Bengal was too
                  big to be efficiently administered by a single Provincial
                  Government.
                </li>
                <li>
                  However, the real objective was to set up a communal gulf
                  between the Hindus and Muslims.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Indian National Congress and the nationalists of Bengal
                  firmly opposed the Partition. Within Bengal, different
                  sections of populationâ€” zamindars, merchants, lawyers,
                  students and even women rose up in spontaneous opposition to
                  the partition of their province.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Divide and Rule: </b>The nationalists could see that it was
                  a deliberate attempt to divide the Bengalâ€™s territory on
                  religious grounds as for Eastern part, Muslims will be in
                  majority and for the Western part, the Hindus.

              </ul>
              <h3>Anti-Partition Campaign</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The Anti-Partition movement was initiated on 7th August, 1905.
                  On that day, a massive demonstration against the partition,
                  was organised in the Town Hall in Calcutta.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Rabindranath Tagore</b> composed the National Song
                  <b>Amar Sonar Bangla</b> for the occasion. This song was
                  adopted as National Anthem by Bangladesh in 1971, after its
                  liberation from Pakistan.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>Calcutta Session of INC (1906)</b> Dadabhai Naoroji, the
                  President of the session, declared that
                  <b>Self Government or Swaraj</b>, like that of United Kingdom
                  was the goal of Indian people.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>The Swadeshi and Boycott (1905-1908)</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  It had its origin in the Anti-Partition movement of Bengal.
                  Mass meetings were held all over Bengal, where Swadeshi or the
                  use of Indian goods and the boycott of British goods and also
                  the social boycott of any Indian who used foreign goods were
                  proclaimed and pledged.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Public burning of foreign cloth were organised and shops
                  selling foreign cloths were picketed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  An important aspect of the Swadeshi Movement was the emphasis
                  placed on
                  <b>self reliance</b> or <b>Atmashakti</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Swadeshi Movement had several consequences like flowering
                  of nationalist poetry, journalism, self-reliant and opening
                  many national educational institutions (e.g., Bengal Technical
                  Institute, Bengal National College.).
                </li>
                <li>
                  BC Pal and Chidambram Pillai led
                  <b>Vandemataram Movement</b> in Madras.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b> Extent of mass participation</b>â€”students, women, certain
                  sections of zamindari, labour, some lower middle and middle
                  classes in towns and cities participated for the first time
                  while the Muslims generally kept away.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Why Swadeshi Movement Failed?</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Severe government repression.</li>
                <li>Split in nationalists at Surat.</li>
                <li>Lack of effective organisation.</li>
                <li>
                  With arrest/deportation of all leaders, the movement left
                  leaderless.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Formation of Muslim League</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  All-India Muslim League (popularised as the Muslim League) was
                  established in 1906 in Dhaka.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The League supported Partition of Bengal, opposed the Swadeshi
                  Movement, demanded special safeguards for its community and
                  separate electorate for Muslims.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Surat Split (1907)</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The INC splited into two groups during the session at Surat in
                  1907. Extremists were led by <b>Lal, Bal, Pal</b>, while
                  Moderates were led
                  <b>by GK Gokhale.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Moderates</b> demanded mild constitutional reforms,
                  economic relief, administrative reorganisation and protection
                  of civil rights. They wanted to restrict the Boycott Movement
                  to Bengal and to a boycott of foreign cloth and liquor.

                  The reason given was to curb the menace of revolutionary

                In the First World War (1914-1919), Britain allied with France,

                and Turkey. This period saw the maturing of Indian nationalism.
                The nationalist response to British participation in the First
                World War was three-fold:

                  of the administration for progressive realisation of
                  responsible government in India.

                  The declaration formed the basis of

                  This Act is also known as
                  <b>Government of India Act of 1919</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Central subjects were demarcated and separated from those
                  of the Provincial subjects.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Provincial subjects were further divided into two partsâ€“
                  <b>transferred and reserved</b>. The transferred subjects were
                  to be administered by the Governor with the aid of Ministers
                  responsible to the legislative council. The reserved subjects,
                  on the other hand, were to be administered by the Governor and
                  his executive council without being responsible to the
                  legislative council. This dual scheme of governance was known
                  as <b>â€˜dyarchyâ€™</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It introduced, for the first time,
                  <b>bicameralism in centre</b> and <b>direct elections</b> in
                  the country. Thus, the Indian legislative council was replaced
                  by a bicameral legislature consisting of an Upper House
                  (Council of State) and a Lower House (Legislative Assembly).
                  The majority of members of both the Houses were chosen by
                  direct election.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It required that the <b>three of the six members</b> of the
                  Viceroyâ€™s Executive Council (other than Commander-in-Chief)
                  were to be Indians.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It extended the principle of communal representation by
                  providing separate electorates for Sikhs, Indian Christians,
                  Anglo-Indians and Europeans.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It provided for the appointment of a
                  <b>statutory commission</b> to inquire into and report on its
                  working after ten years of its coming into force.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Drawbacks</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Dyarchy arrangement too complex and irrational to be
                  functional.
                </li>
                <li>Central executive not responsible to legislature.</li>
                <li>Limited franchise.</li>
