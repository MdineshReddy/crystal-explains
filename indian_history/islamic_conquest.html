              <h2>The Arabs</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <h2>Muhammad bin Qasim</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  In 712 AD, <b>Arabs</b> invaded India from the north-west
                  region (Sindh) under <b>Muhammad bin Qasim</b>, who was a
                  general of the <b>Umayyad caliphate</b> (of Damascus, Syria).
                </li>
                <li>
                  He was the first Muslim to have successfully captured Hindu
                  territories and initiate the early Islamic India in 712 AD.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Though his rule lasted only for two years, yet it greatly
                  disturbed the economic life of Sindh and a large number of
                  people and merchants fled from Sindh. However, many Arabs
                  settled down in Sindh and the Arab influence continued for a
                  long period.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h2>The Turks</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The Turks had entered the Abbasid empire (of Baghdad, Iraq) as
                  palace guards and mercenary soldiers but they soon emerged as
                  <b>king-makers</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Towards the close of the 9th century AD, the vast empire of
                  Arab broke up and the Turks who got the upperhand over the
                  Caliphate of Baghdad, established many independant
                  principalities. One of such Turk state was
                  <b>Ghazni</b> (in Afghanistan).
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Subuktigin</b>, the ruler of Ghazni of that period, fought
                  with Jaipala (of Hindu Shahi dynasty), the ruler of western
                  Punjab and defeated him.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Mahmud of Ghazni</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Mahmud Ghazni, the eldest son of Subuktigin, ascended the
                  throne in AD 998. He was the first ruler to hold the title
                  Sultan ("authority").
                </li>
                <li>
                  For India, the only memory of Mahmud is that of a plunderer
                  and destroyer of temples. Mahmud is said to have made
                  <b>17 raids into India</b>. The initial raids were directed
                  against the Hindu Shahi rulers. In 1001 AD, the Hindu Shani
                  ruler Jaipala was again defeated. This time by Mahmud.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Jaipala's son <b>Anandapala</b> succeeded the throne. A
                  decisive battle between Mahmud and Anandapala was fought in
                  1008-09 AD at <b>Waihind</b> during his sixth expedition.
                  Anandapala lost the war.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The objective of Mahmud’s expeditions was to plunder and loot.
                  He was not interested in expanding his empire to India. He
                  <b>plundered Somnath temple</b> (in Gujarat) in 1025 AD (his
                  sixteenth raid).

                    is regarded as the national epic of Iran. It tells mainly
                    the mythical and to some extent the historical past of the
                    Persian Empire from the creation of the world until the

                <li>
                  In c.1030 CE, Mahmud died, and following his death a powerful
                  empire called the <b>Seljuk empire</b> came into being.

                  Though the 17 invasions of India undertaken by Ghazni did not
                  show any systematic effort to conquer the sub-continent, yet
                  they proved very costly to Indian sub-continent. His conquest
                  opened the gates of India to be conquered from the north-west
                  and this made it easier for other Afghan and Turkish rulers to
                  enter India into the Gangetic valley at any time. One such
                  ruler was <b>Muhammad Ghori</b>.

                  Towards the middle of the 12th century, another group of
                  Turkish tribe man
                  <b>shattered the power of the Seljuk Turks</b> called the
                  Ghurids.

                <li>
                  The Ghurids or Ghorids were a dynasty from the <b>Ghor</b>
                  region of present-day central Afghanistan.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Many historians assert that the actual founder of the Islamic
                  Empire in India was Muhammad Ghori, who was the Sultan of the
                  Ghurid empire.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In 1173,Muhammad Ghori ascended the throne at Ghazni. He
                  conquered Multan and upper sindh.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In 1178, he attempted to penetrate into Gujarat by marching
                  across the Rajputana desert, but was completely rooted out by
                  the Solanki (Gujarat) ruler.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He realised the necessity of creating a suitable base in
                  Punjab before venturing upon the conquest of India. He
                  conquered Peshawar, Lahore and Sialkot.
                </li>
                <li>
                  At that period, the Chauhan power under
                  <b>Prithviraj Chauhan</b> had been steadily growing. Chauhans
                  had captured Delhi from the Tomars around the middle of the
                  century.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Both Prithviraj and Muhammad Ghori’s attention towards the
                  Punjab and Ganga valley brought the two ambitious rulers into
                  conflict.
