                <p>
                  The term History is derived from the Greek word,
                  <b>historia</b>, meaning "inquiry". <b>Herodotus</b>, a
                  5th-century BC Greek historian known for writing
                  <b><i>The Histories</i></b
                  >- a detailed account of the Greco-Persian Wars, is considered
                  (atleast within the Western tradition) to be the
                  <b>"father of history"</b>, as he was the first writer to
                  treat historical subjects using a method of systematic
                  investigation.
                </p>
                <h2>Historical Divisions</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>
                  History is divided into three categories pre-history,
                  proto-history, and history.
                </p>
                <h3>Pre-History</h3>
                <p>
                  Pre-History refers to the period before writing was known.
                  Hence, Pre-History can also called
                  <b>Pre-Literary History</b>. Since there are no written
                  records, this period is constructed from the material remains
                  like tools etc. In India, Pre-Historic period comprises of the
                  three stone ages.
                </p>
                <h3>Proto-History</h3>
                <p>
                  Proto-History is a period between prehistory and history,
                  during which a culture or society has not yet developed
                  writing but are mentioned in the written records of other
                  literate civilizations. For Example:
                </p>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    There are traces of a script (found on different seals)
                    discovered at different sites of Harappan civilization. But
                    the script has not yet been deciphered so far. However
                    Mesopotamian writings mentions trade with the Harappan
                    civilisation. Therefore, Harappan civilization has been
                    considered a part of proto-history.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    There was no consensus among historians whether vedic period
                    is a part of proto-history or not. Although there are
                    definite written records belonging to this period, some
                    historians argue that those were written long after they had
                    been orally transmitted for ages.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>History</h3>

                <p>
                  History refers to the study of socities, past the invention of
                  writing. Their history is constructed using both the written
                  and archaeological sources.
                </p>

                <h2>The Stone Ages</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>

                <p>
                  The early man in India used tools made of crude stone. This
                  period is therefore, known as the <b>Stone Age</b>, which has
                  been divided into three phases:
                </p>

                <ul>
                  <li>The Palaeolithic or Old Stone Age</li>
                  <li>The Mesolithic or Middle Stone Age</li>
                  <li>The Neolithic or New Stone Age</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>The Palaeolithic Age (5,00,000 BCE - 10,000 BCE)</h3>
                <ul style="list-style-type: circle">
                  <li>
                    The Palaeolithic Age is the earliest period of the Stone
                    Age, which developed in the <b>Pleistocene period</b> or the
                    Ice Age (a

                    where the earth was covered with ice and weather was cold).

                  <li>
                    The Palaeolithic man of India are believed to have belonged
                    to the Negrito race and lived in caves and rock shelters.
                    They did not have knowledge of houses, pottery, agriculture.
                    It was only in later stages they discovered fire.

                  <li>
                    The human beings living in the Paleolithic Age were
                    essentially
                    <b>hunters and gatherers</b> and depended on nature for
                    food.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    They used tools of unpolished rough stones. Since the stone
                    tools were made of a hard rock called â€˜quartziteâ€™,
                    Palaeolithic men are therefore called
                    <b>â€˜Quartzite menâ€™</b>
                    in India.
