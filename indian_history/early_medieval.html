              <h2>The Harsha Period</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <h3>Pushyabhuti/Vardhana Dynasty</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The decline of the Gupta Empire had resulted in the splitting
                  of northern India into several kingdoms.
                </li>
                <li>
                  An important ruling family to gain prominence after the fall
                  of the Gupta was that of the Pushyabhutis, who had their
                  capital at
                  <b>Thanesar</b>
                  (Haryana).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Not much is known about the first three kings of the dynasty
                  and most likely the dynasty came into prominence with the
                  accession of
                  <b>Prabhakar Vardhana</b>, who aided the Maukhari king
                  Avanti-Varman of <b>Kannauj</b>(UP) to defeat the Hunas
                  (central asian tribe).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Prabhakara's daughter Rajyashri married Avanti-Varman's son
                  Graha-Varman. As a result of this marriage, Prabhakara's
                  political status increased significantly. He was succeeded by
                  his elder son
                  <b>Rajyavardhana</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Graha-Varman (ruler of Kannauj), husband of Rajyashri (sister
                  of Rajyavardhana) was murdered by Devagupta (ruler of Malwa)
                  in alliance with Shashanka of Gauda (Bengal).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Rajyavardhana killed Devagupta but was himself killed by
                  Shashanka in AD 606. Prabhakara's younger son
                  <b>Harsha-Vardhana</b> then ascended the throne.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Harshavardhana (AD 606-647)</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Harsha, also known as <b>Siladitya</b>, ascended the throne in
                  <b>AD 606</b> and from this year, Harsha Era began.
                </li>
                <li>Harsha made <b>Kannauj</b>(UP) his capital</li>
                <li>
                  At the height of Harsha's power, his Empire covered much of
                  North and Northwestern India, extended East till Kamarupa
                  (Assam), and South until Narmada River.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In Eastern India, he faced opposition from Shaivite king
                  <b>Shashanka of Gauda</b>. Harsha defeated Shashanka.
                </li>

                <li>
                  The Chinese pilgrim <b>Hiuen Tsang</b> (or Xuanzang ) visited
                  India during Harsha period and wrote a very favourable account
                  of him, praising his justice and generosity.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Harsha governed his empire on almost the same lines as the
                  Guptas, that his administration was feudal and decentralised.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Harsha was not rigid in his religious views and practices. His
                  court poet Bana describes him as a Shaivite. According to the
                  Chinese Buddhist traveller Hiuen Tsang, Harsha was a devout
                  Buddhist. Harsha established a
                  <b>large monastery at Nalanda</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Harsha was a great patron of the arts and learning. He was
                  very talented himself as it is believed that he wrote three
                  dramas. According to
                  <b>Banabhatta</b>, he was also an accomplished flute player.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Harsha was defeated in Deccan by <b>Pulakesin-II</b>, the
                  Chalukyan king of Vatapi.
                </li>
                <li>
                  After the death of Harsha in AD 657, the empire once again
                  broke up into petty states.This continued up to the 8th
                  century, when the Gurjara Praticharas and the Rajput rulers
                  emerged as a big force in northern India.
                </li>

              <h3>The Western Chalukyas of Badami/Vatapi</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  As we have seen, the Satavahanas were succeeded by the
                  Vakatakas. The Vakatakas were followed by the Chalukyas of
                  Badami, who played a prominent role in the history of Deccan
                  and south India for about two hundred years from the beginning
                  of the 6th century CE.
                </li>
                <li>
                  They had their capital at <b>Vatapi</b> (modern Badami in
                  Karnataka).
                </li>
                <li>
                  The founder of this dynasty was <b>Pulakeshin I</b>, who
                  established the independent power of this dynasty.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Pulkeshin II (c. 610âˆ’642 CE)</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The most powerful and famous king of this dynasty, who
                  achieved many military successes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Contemporary of Harsha Vardhana and defeated him on the banks
                  of river Narmada. He thus acquired the title of
                  <b>dakshinapatheshvara</b> (lord of the south).
                </li>
                <li>
                  He had conflicts with the <b>Pallavas of Kanchi</b> and
                  annexed the region between Krishna and Godavari (popularly
                  known as <b>Vengi</b>) from the Pallavas and placed it under
                  his brother <b>Vishnuvardhana</b> (<b
                    >Chalukyas of Vengi/Eastern Chalukyas</b
                  >). Thus, the first expedition against the Pallavas, who were
                  at the time ruled by <b>Mahendravarman I</b>, was a complete
                  success. However, the second expedition against the Pallavas
                  proved to be a complete failure as King
                  <b>Narsimhavarman</b> of the Pallava dynasty killed Pulkeshin
                  II and adopted the title of <b>Vatapikonda</b>.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Later Rulers</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The Badami Chalukya dynasty went into a brief decline
                  following the death of Pulakeshin II due to internal feuds.
                </li>
                <li>
                  They ruled from Vengi until about the 10th century. In the
                  western Deccan, the rise of the Rashtrakutas in the middle of
                  the 8th century eclipsed the Chalukyas of Badami before being
                  revived by their descendants, the Western Chalukyas, in the
                  late 10th century. These Western Chalukyas ruled from
                  <b>Kalyani</b> (modern Basavakalyan, Bidar in Karnataka) until
                  the end of the 12th century.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Art and Architecture</h4>
              <p>
                Culturally, Chalukyan period is noted for the growth of art and
                architecture in Deccan. Their style of architecture is called
                â€˜Chalukyan architectureâ€™. They developed Deccan or Vesara style
                of temple-building, which reached its culmination under the
                Rashtrakutas and Hoyasalas. Most of the Chalukyan
                temple-building activity were concentrated in a relatively small
                area of Aihole, Badami, Pattadakal (a UNESCO World Heritage
                site) and Mahakuta in modern Karnataka state.

              <h3>The Eastern Chalukyas of Vengi</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Pulakesin II conquered the Vengi region in eastern Deccan and
                  in 624 CE appointed his brother Vishnuvardhana as the governor
                  of this newly acquired territory. Probably after the death of
                  Pulkeshin II,
                  <b>Vishnuvardhana</b> declared independence and thus the
                  Eastern Chalukyas of Vengi came into prominence.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Initially, the capital of the Eastern Chalukyas was Vengi
                  (near modern Eluru) but later it was moved to
                  <b>Rajamahendravaram</b> (modern Rajamundry).
                </li>
                <li>
                  The five centuries of the Eastern Chalukya rule of Vengi saw
                  not only the consolidation of this region into a unified
                  whole, but also saw the
                  <b> efflorescence of Telugu culture</b>, literature, poetry,
                  and art.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Near the end of tenth century, the Eastern Chalukyas of Vengi
                  were conquered by the Chola king <b>Rajaraja</b> . They
                  continued ruling the region as feudatories of the Cholas until
                  the end of 12th century. Their kingdom ultimately succumbed to
                  the Hoysalas and the Yadavas.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>The Pallavas of Kanchi</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  On the ruins of the Satavahanas, in the eastern part of the
                  peninsula (especially in the Krishnaâˆ’Guntur region), arose the
                  <b>Ikshvakus</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Ikshvakus were supplanted by the Pallavas. They are from
                  <b>Tondaimandalam</b> (the land between the north Penner and
                  north Vellar rivers), mostly comprising of southern Andhra
                  Pradesh and northern Tamil Nadu with their capital at
                  <b>Kanchi</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Simhavishnu</b>: He supposedly defeated the Ikshvakus and
                  laid a firm foundation for the Pallava empire.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Mahendravarman I (c. 590âˆ’630 CE)</b>: During his reign,
                  conflict between the Chalukyas of Badami and the Pallavas
                  heightened and he was defeated by Pulekshin II who annexed the
                  northern part of the Pallava kingdom. He initiated the
                  construction of the famous
                  <b>shore temple at Mahabalipuram</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Narasimhavarman I/Mahamalla (c.630âˆ’668 CE)</b>: Avenged his
                  fatherâ€™s defeat and not only defeated Pulkeshin II but also
                  invaded the Western Chalukyan kingdom and captured Badami.It
                  is in honour of Narasimhavarman I that Mahabalipuram is also
                  known as <b>Mamallapuram</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In c.893 CE, the Pallavas were ultimately overthrown by the
                  Chola king
                  <b>Aditya I</b> and the area of Tondaimandalam passed under
                  the suzerainty of the Cholas. Culturally, the reign of
                  Pallavas is important for the growth of
                  <b>Tamil bhakti literature</b> and the Dravidian style of art
                  and architecture in south India. It was under them that
                  Mahabalipuram emerged as an important centre of temple
                  architecture.

              <p>
                The period from c.750âˆ’1000 CE was marked by the growth of three
                important political powers, namely, the
                <b>Gurjaraâˆ’Pratiharas</b> (who dominated the western India and
                the upper Gangetic valley till the middle of the 10th century),
                the <b>Palas</b> (who ruled over eastern India till the middle
                of the 9th century), and the <b>Rashtrakutas</b> (who dominated
                the Deccan and also controlled territories in north and south
                India). These three kingdoms were constantly fighting with each
                other with an aim to set up their control on the Gangetic region
                in northern India. This conflict among these three powers is
                often described as the <b>â€˜tripartite struggleâ€™</b>.
              </p>
              <h3>The Gurjara Pratihara dynasty</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The dynasty was founded by <b>Harichandra</b> in and around
                  Jodhpur, south western Rajasthan.
                </li>
                <li>
                  They came to prominence in the second quarter of the 8th
                  century, during the reign of <b>Nagabhatta I</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b> Bhoja I / Mihir Bhoja</b> (c.836âˆ’885 CE) proved to be the
                  most successful and popular ruler of Pratiharas. He had his
                  capital at <b> Kannauj</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Gurjaraâˆ’Pratiharas were instrumental in containing Arab
                  armies moving east of the Indus.
                </li>
                <li>
                  By the 10th century AD, several feudatories of the empire took
                  advantage of the temporary weakness of the Gurjara-Pratiharas
                  to declare their independence, notably the Paramaras of Malwa,
                  the Chandelas of Bundelkhand, the Tomaras of Haryana, and the
                  Chauhans of Rajputana.

                  <b>Gopala</b> founded the Pala Empire in 750 AD. His son

                <li>
                  The Palas were followers of the Mahayana and Tantric schools
                  of Buddhism.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Dharmpala <b>revived Nalanda University</b>, which had been
                  famous all over the eastern world. He also
                  <b>founded the Vikramshila University</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Pala period is considered
                  <b>one of the golden eras in the history of Bengal</b>. The
                  Palas brought stability and prosperity to Bengal after
                  centuries of civil war between warring divisions.

                  Founded by <b>Dantidurga</b> around 753, the Rashtrakuta
                  Empire ruled from its capital at
                  <b>Manyakheta/Malkhed</b> (Karnataka) for almost two

                    The Western Chalukya Empire ruled most of the western
                    Deccan, South India, between the 10th and 12th centuries.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Their capital was Kalyani (modern Basavakalyan, Bidar
                    district in Karnataka)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    During this period the other major ruling families of the
                    Deccan, the Hoysalas, the Yadavas of Devagiri, the Kakatiya
                    dynasty and the Southern Kalachuris, were subordinates of
                    the Western Chalukyas and gained their independence only
                    when the power of the Chalukya waned during the latter half
                    of the 12th century.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The Western Chalukyas developed an architectural style known
                    today as a transitional style, an architectural link between
                    the style of the early Chalukya dynasty and that of the
                    later Hoysala empire. Most of its monuments are in the
                    districts bordering the Tungabhadra River in central
                    Karnataka. Well known examples are the
                    <b>Kasivisvesvara Temple</b> at Lakkundi, the
                    <b>Mallikarjuna Temple</b> at Kuruvatti,

                    This was an important period in the development of fine arts
                    in Southern India, especially in literature as the Western
                    Chalukya kings encouraged writers in the native language of
                    Kannada, and Sanskrit like the philosopher and statesman
                    <b>Basava</b> and the great mathematician
                    <b>Bhaskara II</b>.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  The Cholas, famous in Indian history for their
                  <b>local self-government</b>, founded a mighty empire in
                  southern India during c. 850âˆ’1200 CE.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The relationship between these Cholas, called the
                  <b>â€˜Imperial Cholas of Tanjoreâ€™</b>, with the earlier Cholas
                  mentioned in Sangam literature is not very clear.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Cholas came to power after over throwing the authority of
                  the Pallavas in South India.
                </li>
                <li>
                  They developed a <b>strong navy</b>, which further aided them
                  to develop sea trade in the Indian Ocean and to conquer Sri
                  Lanka and the Maldives Islands.

                </li>
                <li>
                  He completely overran the Pandyas and Cheras and included them

                <li>
                  In 1022 CE, he led an expedition to the north, crossed the

                  (meaning â€˜the Chola conqueror of Gangaâ€™) and established a new

                  The last powergul ruler was <b>Rajadhiraja</b>. The later
                  rulers tried to maintain the Chola empire but the Chola power
                  gradually declined and the dynasty came to an end in the 13th
                  century.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The place of the Cholas was taken by the Pandyas and the
                  Hoysalas in the south, and of the later Chalukyas by the
                  Yadavas and the Kakatiyas. These states too extended patronage
                  to arts and architecture. But unfortunately, they weakened
                  themselves by continually fighting against each other, sacking
                  towns and not even sparing the temples. Finally, in the
                  beginning of 14th century, they were destroyed by the Sultans
                  of Delhi.
