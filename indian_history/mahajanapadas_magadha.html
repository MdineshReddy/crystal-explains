      content="Mahajanapadas refers to the territorial states that followed the vedic period in sixth century BC. Out of the 16 Mahajanapadas, the Magadha emerged victorious in dominating the remaining states due to powerful dynsaties that ruled it. This period also witnessed many foreign invasions in north-west India, the popular of which is Alexander's invasion."

              <div class="underline"></div>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The sixth century BCE is known as an era of
                  <b>‘Second Urbanisation’</b> in the Indian Subcontinent. It
                  also marked the beginning of <b>NBPW</b> (Northern Black
                  Polished Ware) culture.
                </li>
                <li>
                  After the decline of the Harappan towns and nearly after a gap
                  of more than a thousand years, urban centres emerged again but
                  not in the Indus plain. The centre of economic and political
                  activity shifted from the North-West, Punjab, Haryana, and
                  Western UP, to Eastern UP and Bihar (Ganga Basin).
                </li>
                <li>
                  This region was not only fertile on account of better rainfall
                  and river systems, but was also closer to the
                  <b>iron production centres</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The use of better iron tools and weapons enabled some
                  territorial states to become very large, and they came to be
                  called <b>Mahajanapadas</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  According to Buddhist texts, <b>Anguttara Nikaya</b>, the land
                  between Himalayas and Narmada was divided into
                  <b>16 independent states (Mahajanapadas)</b>:

                  The most powerful states of them were
                  <b>Magadha, Kosala, Vatsa, and Avanti</b>. Two of the
                  Mahajanapadas, the <b>Vajji and Malla</b> were
                  <b>Gana-Sanghas</b>. Unlike kingdoms, the Gana-Sanghas
                  (literally meaning 'assembly') had no king, instead they are
                  governed by a small group of people (notably the rich, also

              <div class="underline"></div>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The political conflict among the Mahajanapadas ultimately led
                  to the emergence of Magadha as the most powerful state and the
                  centre of a vast empire.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Magadha’s rise to political supremacy began with Bimbisara,
                  who belonged to the Haryanka dynasty.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Cause of the Rise of Magadha</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Advantageous geographical location of the capital cities.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Abundance of natural resources such as iron, helped in
                  preparing effective weapons.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The alluvial soil of the Gangetic plains and sufficient
                  rainfall aided for surplus agriculture produce.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Unorthodox character of Magadhan society and ambitious rulers.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Haryanka Dynasty</h3>
              <h4>Bimbisara</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>He was contemporary of Buddha and Mahavira.</li>
                <li>
                  He had his capital at <b>Rajgriha</b> (Girivraja), which was
                  an impressive city and almost impregnable as surrounded by
                  five hills.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Earlier, he had rivalry with Avanti’s king Pradyota, but later
                  became friends and Bimbisara even sent his royal physician
                  Jivaka to Ujjain (along Dakshinapatha to Avanti) when Pradyota
                  had jaundice.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He conquered Anga (East Bihar). Anga, and especially its
                  capital, Champa, were important for inland and maritime trade.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He strengthened his position by three matrimonial alliances:

                  <li>
                    His first wife was from Kosala named Mahakoshala (sister of
                    King Prasenjit), who brought in dowry the territory of
                    Kashi.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    He married lichchhavi Princess Chellana (sister of Vajji
                    King Chetaka) from Vaishali, who gave birth to Ajatashatru.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    He married the daughter of the chief of the Madra clan
                    (Punjab).
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <li>
                  He was the first Indian King to have a regular and standing
                  army.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Ajatashatru</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  He was the son of Bimbisara. It is believed that he seized the
                  throne by killing his father.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He annexed Kosala (ruled by his maternal uncle Prasenjit) and
                  Vajji (ruled by Chetak, his maternal grandfather).
                </li>
                <li>
                  He used two innovative military weapons:
                  <span title="remember bahubali?">
                    War engine, which was used to throw stones like catapults

              <h4>Udayin</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>He was the son and successor of Ajatashatru.</li>
                <li>
                  He founded the new capital at <b>Pataliputra</b> (modern
                  Patna), situated at the confluence of Ganga and Son rivers.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He was succeeded by weak rulers and most of them were
                  parricides (i.e., killed their parent(s)).
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Shishunaga Dynasty</h3>
              <h4>Shishunaga</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Shishunaga was earlier a Viceroy/Amatya (high ranking
                  official) at Varanasi (Banaras), and it is believed that the
                  people of Magadha, outraged by the successive parricides of
                  the successors of Udayin, appointed Shishunaga as king.
                </li>
                <li>He temporarily shifted capital to <b>Vaishali</b>.</li>
                <li>
                  The most important achievement of Shishunaga was to
                  <b>defeat Avanti</b> (Pradyota Dynasty) and make it a part of
                  Magadha.
                </li>

              <ul>
                <li>He was the son and successor of Shishunaga.</li>
                <li>
                  During his reign, second Buddhist Council was held at
                  Vaishali.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  The Shishunaga dynasty was overthrown by Mahapadma who
                  established a new line of kings known as the Nandas. It is
                  considered to be the first non-Kshatriya dynasty.

                <li>
                  He was believed to be belonged to a non-Kshatriya caste. The
                  Nandas were considered <b>adharmika</b> (those who do not
                  follow the norms of Dharma). He was also called
                  Sarvashatrantak, i.e., uprooter of all the Kshatriyas
                  (Puranas)

                <li>

                </li>
                <li>
                  He made methodical collection of taxes by regularly appointing
                  officials. He also built canals and did a lot of irrigation

                  It is believed that <b> Alexander</b> attacked Punjab during

                </li>
                <li>
                  He is believed to be an arrogant and oppressive ruler who
                  imposed heavy taxes on the common man. His greed and

                  Alexander, the king of Macedonia brought the mighty Persian
                  (Iran) empire to its knee. From Iran, he marched towards
                  India, attracted by its great wealth and divided polity.

                  Alexander conquered Kabul in 328 BC. He moved to India through

                  the banks of the river Hydaspes (Jhelum), but was impressed by
                  his bravery, so he restored to Porus, his kingdom and made him
                  his ally.
