              <h1 class="title">THE MAURYAN EMPIRE</h1>
              <h2 class="title">(c. 324–185 BCE)</h2>
              <p>
                The Mauryan period is a remarkable period in the early history
                of Indian subcontinent. It not only marks the establishment of
                the
                <b>first subcontinental empire</b>, but also the development of
                innovative and comparatively stable governance strategies.
                Leaving Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and some parts of north-eastern
                India, the Mauryas ruled over the whole of the sub-continent.
              </p>
              <h3>Major Literary Sources</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b> Arthashashtra of Kautliya (Chanakya or Vishnugupta): </b>
                  Written in Sanskrit by Prime Minister of Chandragupta Maurya,
                  it is a treatise on state craft and public administration
                  under Mauryas.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b> Indica of Megasthenese:</b> sheds light on the
                  Socioeconomic and administrative structure under Mauryas;
                  India free from slavery; 7-castes system and usuary in India.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Vishakha Datta’s Mudra-rakshasa:</b> It describes how
                  Chandragupta Maurya got Chanakya’s assistance to overthrow the
                  Nandas. Besides this, it gives an excellent account of the
                  prevailing socio-economic conditions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Dipavamsa</b> and <b>Mahavamsa</b> (Sri Lankan chronicles):
                  Ashoka’s role in spreading of Buddhism in Sri Lanka.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h2>The Mauryan Dynasty</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <h3>Chandragupta Maurya (324/321 – 297 BCE)</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  With the help of his mentor <b>Chanakya/Kautilya</b>,
                  Chandragupta Maurya dethroned the last Nanda ruler Dhanananda
                  and founded the Mauryan dynasty with its capital at
                  <b>Pataliputra</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He was called <b>Sandrocottus</b> by the Greek scholars. Greek
                  sources account for the conflict between Chandragupta Maurya
                  and <b> Seleucus Nikator</b> (who was one of the generals of
                  Alexander, and after his death, succeeded in gaining control
                  over most of the eastern Asiatic provinces). Chandragupta
                  defeated him around 301 BCE and Seleucus was compelled to
                  yield north-west parts of Indian sub-continent to him in
                  return for 500 elephants.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Seleucus sent an ambassador to the Mauryan court,
                  <b>Megasthenes</b> (who wrote the Indica).
                </li>
                <li>
                  According to Jain texts and tradition, Chandragupta adopted
                  Jainism and went to the hills of Shravana Belagola (near
                  Mysore) with
                  <b>Bhadrabahu</b> and committed Sallekhana (death by slow
                  starvation).
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Bindusara (297 – 273 BCE)</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Greek writers address him as <b>Amitrochates</b> (destroyer of
                  foes).
                </li>
                <li>
                  He was credited with conquering ‘the land between the two
                  seas’, i.e., the Arabian sea and the Bay of Bengal.
                </li>
                <li>He patronised and joined the Ajivika sect.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Ashoka (268 – 232 BCE)</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  During the reign of Bindusara, Ashoka was appointed the
                  viceroy of Taxila and Ujjain. It is believed that, after
                  Bindusara's death, ashoka usurped the throne by having his
                  brothers killed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He was regarded as one of the greatest kings of all times, and
                  probably was the first ruler to maintain direct contact with
                  his people through his inscriptions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The various names of the emperor include
                  <b>Buddhashakya</b> and <b> Ashoka</b> (in the Maski Edict),
                  <b>Dharmasoka</b> (Sarnath inscription),

                  His empire covered the whole territory from Hindukush to
                  Bengal, and extended over Afghanistan, Baluchistan, and the
                  whole of India including Kashmir and the valleys of Nepal (the
                  first empire to do so), with the exception of a small area in
                  the far south (which, according to
                  <b>rock edict 13</b>, were inhabited by the Cholas and
                  Pandyas, and according to <b>rock edict 2</b>, by the
                  Keralaputras and Satiyaputras).

                  His conquest of Kalinga (262–261 BCE), proved to be the
                  pivotal event of his life. Although Ashoka won the war, the
                  deaths and destruction caused by the war, completely changed
                  him. After the annexation of Kalinga was completed, Ashoka
                  embraced the teachings of Buddhism, and renounced war and
                  violence. He sent out missionaries to travel around Asia and
                  spread Buddhism to other countries.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Buddhism for the first time went outside India during his
                  reign. He sent his son Mahendra and daughter Sanghamitra to
                  Ceylon (Sri Lanka).
                </li>
                <li>
                  He appointed <b>Dharma Mahamattas</b> to propagate dharma
                  among various social groups. Organized the third Buddhist
                  council at Pataliputra, after which he sent Buddhist
                  missionaries to Ceylon.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He banned animal sacrifice, regulated the slaughter of animals
                  for food, and established dharmashalas, hospitals throughout
                  his kingdom.
                </li>

              <h3>Later Rulers</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The Maurya empire declined rapidly after Ashoka and the later
                  kings had very short reigns.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The empire became weak and fragmented, and the Mauryan dynasty
                  came to an end when the last king, <b>Brihadratha</b>, was
                  killed by his military commander, <b>Pushyamitra Shunga</b>,
                  in 185 BCE.

              <div class="underline"></div>
              <h3>Ashoka's Dhamma</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Ashoka's Dhamma (prakrit word for Dharma) was not given any
                  formal definition or structure. It emphasized:
                </li>
                <ul style="list-style-type: square">
                  <li>
                    tolerance of people and the notion of showing consideration
                    towards slaves and servants;
                  </li>
                  <li>obedience to elders;</li>
                  <li>generosity towards the needy, Brahmans and Sramanas.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>
                  Ashoka pleaded for tolerance of different religious sects in
                  an attempt to create a sense of harmony. The policy of Dhamma
                  also laid stress on non-violence, which was to be practiced by
                  giving up war and conquests and also as a restraint on the
                  killing of animals.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Ashokan Inscriptions</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The history of Ashoka is reconstructed on the basis of his
                  inscriptions. These inscriptions throw light not only on the
                  reign of Ashoka, but also reveal his external and domestic
                  policies, his views about dhamma, and the extent of his
                  empire.
                </li>
                <li>
                  There are total 33 inscriptions and are primarily classified
                  into
                  <b>Major Rock Edicts</b>, <b>Minor Rock Edicts</b>,
                  <b>Major Pillar Edicts</b>, and <b>Minor Pillar Edicts</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In his inscriptions, Brahmi, Kharosthi, Prakrit, Aramaic, and
                  Greek languages (deciphered by James Prinsep in c.1837 CE)
                  have been used.

                    They were mostly inscribed on well-polished sandstone
                    <b>monolithic pillars</b> (quarried from the sites of
                    <b>Chunar</b>, near Varanasi).

                  <li>
                    On top of bell capital is a <b>platform</b> (called abacus)
                    which is intended to support the crowned animal.

                  <li>
                    Two pillars, one from Topra and the other from Meerut, were
                    shifted to Delhi by <b>Feroz Shah Tughlaq</b>.

              <h3>Army</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The most striking feature of Mauryan administration was
                  maintenance of a huge army. They also maintained a Navy.
                </li>
                <li>
                  According to Megasthenes the administration of Army was
