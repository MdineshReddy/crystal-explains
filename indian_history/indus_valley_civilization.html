                  referred to as 'first urbanisation' in Indian Subcontinent.

                  A unique feature was the <b>grid system</b> i.e. streets

                  They had an excellent drainage system connecting all houses to
                  the main street drainage made of mortar, lime and gypsum and
                  covered with large brick slabs and equipped with 'Manhole' for

                  Houses were often of two or more storeys. No window faced the

                  There were lamp-posts at intervals. They used burnt bricks of

                  It was the backbone of the civilisation. The soil was fertile
                  and the river Indus, being a perennial river provided water
                  throughout the year.
                </li>

                  Agriculture, industry and forest produce provided the basis
                  for internal and external trade.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Trade was based on <b>barter system</b>. Coins were not

                </li>
                <li>

                  Harappan civilisation is considered as a secular society as
                  <b>no temples have been found</b>. Sacred ritual spots
                  included the Great Bath at Mohenjo-Daro.
                  <b>Idolatry was practiced.</b> The Harappan people generally
                  worshipped:
                </li>
                <ul style="list-style-type: square">

              <h2>Decline of the civilisation</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                The Harappan culture flourished till about 1900 BC, then it
                began to decline. There is no unanimity among historians,
                regarding the exact reason for the decline of this urban
                civilisation. Historians have three prominent theories in this
                context:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <b>Conquest</b>: It is possible that the people from this
                  civilisation were completely overrun by people from the
                  Central Asia (Aryans).
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b> Environmental Disaster:</b> It's possible that they
                  brought about their own end by destroying their environment.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Earthquake:</b> The most interesting theory is that a
                  massive earthquake changed the course of the rivers so much
                  that a lot of the tributaries dried up. Without adequate water
                  supplies for irrigation, the cities couldn't sustain
                  themselves, so people literally picked up and left for greener
                  pastures.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <br />
