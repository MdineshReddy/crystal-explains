              <h2>Dominion of India (1947-1950)</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Independent India's first years were marked with turbulent
                  events – a massive exchange of population with Pakistan, the
                  Indo-Pakistani War of 1947 and the integration of over 500
                  princely states to form a united nation.
                </li>
                <li>
                  An estimated 3.5 million Hindus and Sikhs living in West
                  Punjab, North-West Frontier Province, Baluchistan, East Bengal
                  and Sind migrated to India in fear of domination and
                  suppression in Muslim Pakistan. Communal violence killed an
                  estimated one million Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The violence was stopped by early September owing to the
                  co-operative efforts of both Indian and Pakistani leaders, and
                  especially due to the efforts of Gandhi who undertook a
                  <b>fast-unto-death in Calcutta</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Gandhi was assasinated on 30 January 1948 was carried out by
                  <b>Nathuram Vinayak Godse</b> who held him responsible for
                  partition and charged that Gandhi was appeasing Muslims. More
                  than one million people flooded the streets of Delhi to follow
                  the procession to cremation grounds and pay their last
                  respects.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Integration of princely states</h3>
              <p>
                By the Indian Independent Act of 1947, the princes of the
                princely states were given the right to either remain
                independent or join either dominion. Thus India's leaders were
                faced with the prospect of inheriting a
                <b>fragmented nation</b>.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel</b> convinced the rulers of princely
                states contiguous to India to accede to India. Many rights and
                privileges of the rulers of the princely states, especially
                their personal estates and <b>privy purses</b>, were guaranteed
                to convince them to accede. Of the 552 princely states situated
                within the geographical boundaries of India, 549 joined India.
                There were three states that proved more difficult to integrate
                than others:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Junagadh, Gujarat</b> (Hindu-majority state with a Muslim
                  Nawab) – a December 1947
                  <b>plebiscite (direct voting)</b> resulted in a 99% vote to
                  merge with India, annulling (invalidating) the controversial
                  accession to Pakistan, which was made by the Nawab against the
                  wishes of the people of the state who were overwhelmingly
                  Hindu and despite Junagadh not being contiguous with Pakistan.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Hyderabad</b> (Hindu-majority state with a Muslim nizam)–
                  Patel ordered the Indian army to depose the government of the
                  Nizam, code-named <b>Operation Polo</b>, after the failure of
                  negotiations, which was done between 13–29 September 1948. It
                  was incorporated as a state of India the next year.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b
                    >The area of Kashmir (Muslim-majority state with a Hindu
                    king)</b
                  >
                  in the far north of the subcontinent quickly became a source
                  of controversy that erupted into the
                  <b>First Indo-Pakistani War</b> which lasted from
                  <b>1947 to 1949</b>. Eventually, a United Nations-overseen
                  ceasefire was agreed that left India in control of two-thirds
                  of the contested region. Jawaharlal Nehru initially agreed to
                  Mountbatten's proposal that a plebiscite be held in the entire
                  state as soon as hostilities ceased, and a UN-sponsored
                  cease-fire was agreed to by both parties on 1 Jan. 1949. No
                  statewide plebiscite was held, however, for in 1954, after
                  Pakistan began to receive arms from the United States, Nehru
                  withdrew his support. The Indian Constitution came into force
                  in Kashmir on 26 January 1950 with special clauses for the
                  state.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <br />

              <p>
                <b>Constitution</b>: The Constituent Assembly adopted the
                Constitution of India, drafted by a committee headed by
                <b>Dr. B. R. Ambedkar</b>, on <b>26 November 1949</b>. India
                became a <b>sovereign democratic republic</b> after its
                constitution came into effect on <b> 26 January 1950</b>.
                <b>Dr. Rajendra Prasad</b> became the first President of India.

                  India held its <b>first national elections</b> under the
                  Constitution in <b>1952</b>. The
                  <b>National Congress Party won an overwhelming majority</b>,
                  and Jawaharlal Nehru began a second term as Prime Minister.
                  President Prasad was also elected to a second term by the
                  electoral college of the first Parliament of India.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Parliament passed extensive reforms that increased the
                  legal rights of women in Hindu society, and further legislated
                  against caste discrimination and untouchability.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Nehru advocated a strong initiative to enroll India's children
                  to complete primary education, and thousands of schools,
                  colleges and institutions of advanced learning, such as the
                  <b>Indian Institutes of Technology</b>, were founded across
                  the nation.

                <li>
                  Nehru advocated a <b>socialist model</b> for the economy of

                    <b>Five-Year Plans</b> were shaped by the
                    <b>Soviet model</b> based on centralised and integrated
                    national economic programs — no taxation for Indian farmers,
                    minimum wage and benefits for blue-collar workers, and the
                    <b>nationalisation of heavy industries</b> such as steel,

                  Village common lands were seized, and an extensive public
                  works and industrialisation campaign resulted in the

                  Prime Minister Nehru led the Congress to major election

                  Language as a basis for reorganization was rejected by

                  However, in <b>October, 1953</b>, the Government of India was
                  forced to create the <b>first linguistic state</b>, known as
                  <b>Andhra state</b>, by separating the Telugu speaking areas
                  from the Madras state. This followed a prolonged popular
                  agitation and the death of <b>Potti Sriramulu</b>, a Congress
                  person of standing, after a 56- day hunger strike for the

                  <b>Fazl Ali Commissio</b>n also known as States Reorganization

                  Old states were dissolved and new states created on the lines

                    The separation of <b>Kerala</b> and the

                    On 1 May 1960, the states of

                  Jawaharlal Nehru died on 27 May 1964, and

                <li>
                  In <b>1965</b>, India and Pakistan again went to
                  <b>war over Kashmir</b>, but without any definitive outcome or
                  alteration of the Kashmir boundary. The
                  <b>Tashkent Agreement</b> was signed under the

                  A leadership election resulted in the

                  been serving as Minister for Information and Broadcasting, as
                  the third Prime Minister. She defeated right-wing leader
                  <b>Morarji Desai (Janata Party)</b>.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Indira Gandhi had started on a rocky note after agreeing to a
                  <b>devaluation of the rupee</b>, which created much hardship
                  for Indian businesses and consumers, and the import of wheat
                  from the United States fell through due to political disputes.

                <li>

              <h3>Indo-Pakistan War of 1971</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 was the <b>third</b> in four
                  wars fought between the two nations. Also known as
                  <b>Bangladesh Liberation War</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In this war, fought over the issue of self-rule in East
                  Pakistan, India decisively defeated Pakistan, resulting in the
                  <b>creation of Bangladesh</b>.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Green revolution and Operation Flood</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  India's population passed the <b>50 crore</b> mark in the
                  early 1970s, but its long-standing food crisis was resolved
                  with greatly improved agricultural productivity due to the
                  <b>Green Revolution</b> mainly led by agricultural scientist
                  <b>M. S. Swaminathan</b>. The government sponsored modern
                  agricultural implements, new varieties of generic seeds, and
                  increased financial assistance to farmers that increased the
                  yield of food crops such as wheat, rice and corn, as well as
                  commercial crops like cotton, tea, tobacco and coffee.
                  Increased agricultural productivity expanded across the states
                  of the
                  <b> Indo-Gangetic Plain and the Punjab.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Under <b>Operation Flood</b>, the government encouraged the
                  production of milk, which increased greatly, and improved
                  rearing of livestock across India. This enabled India to
                  become self-sufficient in feeding its own population, ending
                  two decades of food imports.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Annexation of Sikkim</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Till 1947, Sikkim was an Indian princely state ruled by
                  <b>Chogyal</b>. In 1947, after the lapse of British
                  paramountcy, Sikkim became a <b> ‘protectorate’</b> of India,
                  whereby the Indian Government assumed responsibility for the
                  defence, external affairs and communications of Sikkim.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In 1974, Sikkim expressed its desire for greater association
                  with India. Accordingly, the 35th Constitutional Amendment Act
                  (1974) was enacted by the parliament. This amendment
                  introduced a new class of statehood under the constitution by
                  conferring on Sikkim the status of an
                  <b>‘associate state’</b> of the Indian Union. For this
                  purpose, a new <b> Article 2A</b> and a new schedule (Tenth
                  Schedule containing the terms and conditions of association)
                  were inserted in the Constitution.
                </li>
                <li>
                  This experiment, however, did not last long as it could not
                  fully satisfy the aspirations of the people of Sikkim. In a
                  referendum held in
                  <b> 1975</b>, they voted for the abolition of the institution
                  of Chogyal and Sikkim becoming an integral part of India.
                  Consequently, the
                  <b>36th Constitutional Amendment Act (1975)</b> was enacted to
                  make Sikkim a full-fledged state of the Indian Union (the 22nd
                  state). It repealed Article 2A and the Tenth Schedule that
                  were added by the 35th Amendment Act of 1974.

              <h3>Formation of Northeastern states</h3>
              <p>
                In the Northeast India, the state of Assam was divided into
                several states beginning in 1970 within the borders of what was
                then Assam.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  In 1963, the <b>Naga Hills district</b> became the 16th state
                  of India under the name of <b>Nagaland.</b> Part of Tuensang
                  was added to Nagaland.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In 1970, in response to the demands of the
                  <b>Khasi, Jaintia and Garo people</b> of the Meghalaya
                  Plateau, the districts embracing the Khasi Hills, Jaintia
                  Hills, and Garo Hills were formed into an autonomous state
                  within Assam; in 1972 this became a separate state under the
                  name of <b>Meghalaya</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Similarly, in 1972 two Union Territories of Manipur and
                  Tripura were granted statehood.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In 1972, <b>Arunachal Pradesh</b> (the North East Frontier
                  Agency) and
                  <b>Mizoram</b>
                  (from the Mizo Hills in the south) were separated from Assam
                  as union territories; both became states in 1986.

              <h3>Indian Emergency</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Economic and social problems, as well as allegations of
                  corruption, caused increasing political unrest across India.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In 1974, the <b>Allahabad High Court</b> found Indira Gandhi
                  guilty of misusing government machinery for election purposes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Various political parties united and conducted strikes across
                  India.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In 1975, Gandhi advised
                  <b>President Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed</b> to declare a
                  <b>state of emergency</b> under the constitution, which
                  allowed the central government to assume sweeping powers to
                  defend law and order in the nation.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Explaining the breakdown of law and order and threat to
                  national security as her primary reasons, Gandhi suspended
                  many civil liberties and postponed elections at national and
                  state levels. Non-Congress governments in Indian states were
                  dismissed, and many opposition political leaders and activists
                  were imprisoned. Strikes and public protests were outlawed in
                  all forms.
                </li>
                <li>
                  India's <b>economy benefited</b> from an end to paralysing
                  strikes and political disorder. The Government announced a
                  <b>20-point programme</b> which enhanced agricultural and
                  industrial production, increasing national growth,
                  productivity, and job growth. But many organs of government
                  and many Congress politicians were accused of corruption and
                  <b> authoritarian conduct.</b>

              <h3>Janata Emergence</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Indira Gandhi's Congress Party called for general elections in
                  1977, only to suffer a humiliating electoral defeat at the
                  hands of the
                  <b>Janata Party</b>, an amalgamation of opposition parties.

                    of India</b
                  >. The Desai administration established tribunals to
                  investigate Emergency-era abuses, and
                  <b>Indira and her son Sanjay Gandhi were arrested</b> after a

                </li>
                <li>
                  In 1979, the coalition crumbled and
                  <b>Charan Singh</b> (Janata Party) formed an interim
                  government. The Janata Party had become intensely unpopular
                  due to its perceived lack of leadership on solving India's
                  serious economic and social problems.

                  Indira Gandhi and her Party , were swept back into power with
                  a large majority in January 1980.

                  But the rise of an <b>insurgency in Punjab</b> would
                  jeopardise India's security. When Indian forces, undertaking
                  <b>Operation Blue Star</b>, raided the hideout of self-rule
                  pressing <b>Khalistan militants</b> in the Golden Temple —
                  Sikhs’ most holy shrine — in Amritsar, the inadvertent deaths
                  of civilians and damage to the temple building inflamed
                  tensions in the Sikh community across India. The Government
                  used intensive police operations to crush militant operations,
                  but it resulted in many claims of abuse of civil liberties.

                  In Assam, there were many incidents of communal violence
                  between native villagers and refugees from Bangladesh, as well
                  as settlers from other parts of India. Northeast India was
                  paralysed owing to the ULFA's (United Liberation Front of
                  Asom) clash with Government forces.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  The Congress party chose Rajiv Gandhi, Indira's older son, as
                  the next Prime Minister. Rajiv was the youngest Prime Minister
                  ever. The Parliament was dissolved, and Rajiv led the Congress
                  party to its
                  <b> largest majority in history</b> (over 415 seats out of 545
                  possible), reaping a sympathy vote over his mother's
                  assassination.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Rajiv Gandhi initiated a series of reforms: the
                  <b>Licence Raj was loosened</b>, and government restrictions
                  on foreign currency, travel, foreign investment, and imports
                  decreased considerably. This allowed private businesses to use
                  resources and produce commercial goods without government
                  bureaucracy interfering, and the influx of foreign investment
                  increased India's national reserves.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Rajiv broke from his mother's precedent to
                  <b>improve relations with the United States</b>, which
                  increased economic aid and scientific co-operation. Rajiv's
                  encouragement of science and technology resulted in a
                  <b
                    >major expansion of the telecommunications industry and
                    India's space programme</b
                  >, and
                  <b
                    >gave birth to the software industry and information

                <li>
                  India in 1987 brokered an agreement with the Government of Sri
                  Lanka and agreed to deploy troops for peacekeeping operation
                  in Sri Lanka's ethnic conflict led by the LTTE (Liberation
                  Tigers of Tamil Eelam). Rajiv sent Indian troops to enforce
                  the agreement and disarm the Tamil rebels, but the Indian
                  Peace Keeping Force, as it was known, became entangled in
                  outbreaks of violence, ultimately ending up fighting the Tamil
                  rebels itself, and becoming a target of attack from Sri Lankan
                  nationalists. V. P. Singh withdrew the IPKF in 1990, but
                  thousands of Indian soldiers had died.

                  Rajiv Gandhi's image as an honest politician (he was nicknamed
                  <b> "Mr. Clean"</b> by the press) was shattered when the
                  <b>Bofors scandal broke</b>, revealing that senior government
                  officials had taken bribes over defence contracts by a Swedish
                  guns producer.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  General elections in 1989 gave Rajiv's Congress a
                  <b>plurality</b>
                  (circumstance when a candidate gets more votes than any other
                  but does not receive more than half of all votes cast.), a far
                  cry from the majority which propelled him to power.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Power came instead to his former finance and defence minister,

                  Party withdrew their support to Singh government, causing them
                  to lose parliamentary vote of confidence on 7 November 1990.

              <p>
                On 21 May 1991, while former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi
                campaigned in Tamil Nadu, a Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
                (LTTE) female suicide bomber assassinated him and many others by
                setting off the bomb in her belt by leaning forward while
                garlanding him. In the elections, Congress (I) won 244
                parliamentary seats and put together a coalition, returning to
                power under the leadership of <b>P.V. Narasimha Rao</b>. This
                Congress-led government, which served a full five-year term,
                initiated a gradual process of
                <b>economic liberalisation and reform</b>, which has opened the
                Indian economy to global trade and investment.
              </p>
              <h3>Economic reforms</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Under the policies initiated by late Prime Minister
                  <b>P. V. Narasimha Rao</b> and his then-Finance Minister
                  <b>Dr. Manmohan Singh</b>, India's economy expanded rapidly.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Rao administration initiated the <b>privatisation</b> of
                  large, inefficient, and loss-inducing government corporations.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Strategies like forming Special Economic Zones – tax
                  amenities, good communications infrastructure, low regulation
                  – to encourage industries has paid off in many parts of the
                  country.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Cities like Bangalore, Hyderabad, Pune, and Ahmedabad have
                  risen in prominence and economic importance, becoming centres
                  of rising industries and destinations for foreign investment
                  and firms.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Foreign investment and outsourcing of jobs to India's labor
                  markets further enhanced India's economic growth.
                </li>
                <li>Unemployment and poverty are steadily declining.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Era of coalitions</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  This period saw many coalition governments that lasted for a
                  small period. Finally On 20 March 1998, the President
                  inaugurated a BJP-led coalition government, with
                  <b>Vajpayee</b> serving as Prime Minister.
                </li>
                <li>
                  On 11 and 13 May 1998, this government conducted a series of
                  <b>five underground nuclear weapons tests</b>, known
                  collectively as <b>Pokhran-II</b> — which caused Pakistan to
                  conduct its own tests that same year.
                </li>
                <li>
                  India's nuclear tests prompted President of the
                  <b>United States</b> Bill Clinton and <b>Japan</b> to impose
                  economic sanctions on India pursuant to the
                  <b>1994 Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act</b> and led to
                  widespread international condemnation.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In the early months of 1999, Prime Minister Vajpayee made a
                  historic bus trip to Pakistan and met with Pakistan's Prime
                  Minister Nawaz Sharif, signing the bilateral
                  <b>Lahore peace declaration</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In May and June 1999, India discovered an elaborate campaign
                  of terrorist infiltration that resulted in the
                  <b>Kargil War</b> in Kashmir, derailing a promising peace
                  process that had begun only three months earlier when Prime
                  Minister Vajpayee visited Pakistan, inaugurating the
                  Delhi-Lahore bus service. Indian forces killed Pakistan-backed
                  infiltrators and reclaimed important border posts in
                  high-altitude warfare.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Soaring on popularity earned following the successful
                  conclusion of the Kargil conflict, the
                  <b>National Democratic Alliance</b> – a new coalition led by
                  the BJP – gained a majority to form a government with Vajpayee
                  as Prime Minister in October 1999.
