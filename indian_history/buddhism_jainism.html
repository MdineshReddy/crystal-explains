              <div class="underline"></div>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Sixth century BCE witnessed the growth of two great
                  alternative religions: <b>Buddhism</b> and <b>Jainism.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  These religions emphasized that true happiness does not lie in
                  material prosperity or performance of rituals, but in
                  nonviolence, charity, and good social conduct.

              </div>
              <h3>Life of Buddha</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Gautama Buddha was born as Siddhartha in 563 BCE on Vaishakha
                  Poornima Day at Lumbini (near Kapilavastu, now situated in the
                  foothills of Nepal) to Suddhodana (chief of republican Sakya
                  clan, who ruled from Kapilavastu in the Kosala Kingdom).
                </li>
                <li>
                  His mother Mahamaya (princess of the Kosala dynasty), gave
                  birth and died seven days after his birth. Siddhartha was thus
                  raised by his step-mother Gautami.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It is believed that soon after he was born, a prophecy
                  foretold that he would become a <b>world renouncer</b>. His
                  father wanted to keep him away from the path of renunciation,
                  hence he shielded him from all sorrows, and brought him up in
                  luxury and comfort. He was married at an early age to
                  Yosodhara from whom he had a son Rahul.
                </li>

                <li>
                  He suspected that there was more to life, so he snuck out of
                  the palace a few times. On these travels, he encountered an
                  old man, a sick man, and finally a corpse. Having realized the
                  ubiquity of suffering, Siddhartha left the palace at the age
                  of 29, renounced the crown and sought out all the holiest men
                  to try to find out how it could be possible that life would
                  come to such a terrible end. This event is known as
                  <b>Mahabhinishkramana</b>
                  /Great Renunciation
                </li>
                <li>
                  Gautama first studied under two teachers of meditation, namely
                  Alara Kalama and Uddaka Ramaputta, learning meditation and
                  philosophy.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Finding these teachings to be insufficient to attain his goal,
                  he turned to the practice of severe asceticism until his body
                  was almost emaciated. Realizing that austerities could not
                  lead to realization, he abandoned them.
                </li>
                <li>
                  At the age of 35, he ultimately attained
                  <b>Nirvana</b>/Enlightenment at Gaya, Magadha (Bihar) under a
                  Peepal tree, on the banks of river Niranjana (also called
                  Phalgu river), and came to be known as the Buddha, the
                  Enlightened One.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Buddha delivered his first Sermon at Sarnath to five of his
                  disciples. This event is known as
                  <b>'DhammaChakka-Pavattana'</b> meaning ‘turning the wheel of
                  dharma’. His five disciples soon realized the truth themselves
                  and became Arhats.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Buddha wandered about, teaching his doctrine for over four
                  decades, and established an order of monks and nuns known as
                  the <b>Sangha</b>. He finally attained
                  <b>Mahaparinirvana or Parinibbana</b> at the age of 80 at
                  Kusinara (lying in Mallas). It is believed that his last words
                  were,
                  <b
                    ><i> “All composite things decay, strive diligently”.</i></b
                  >
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Doctrines of Buddhism</h3>
              <p>
                The core of Buddha’s doctrine is expressed in the Arya Satyas
                (Four Noble Truths), Ashtangika-Marga (Eight-Fold Path), the
                doctrine of Middle Path, Social Code of Conduct, and Belief in
                Nirvana.
              </p>
              <h4>Four Noble Truths (Arya Satyas)</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>The world is full of sorrows (Sabbam Dhukkam).</li>
                <li>The source of suffering is desire.</li>
                <li>To stop suffering, you must rid yourself of desire.</li>
                <li>
                  This can be achieved by following the 8-fold path (Ashtangika
                  Marga).
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Eight-Fold Path (Ashtangika marga)</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Right understanding</li>
                <li>Right thought</li>
                <li>Right speech</li>
                <li>Right effort</li>
                <li>Right action</li>
                <li>Right livelihood</li>
                <li>Right mindfulness</li>
                <li>Right meditation</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Code of Conduct</h4>
              <p>These are the vows or duties of every follower of Buddhism.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Do not covet the property of others.</li>
                <li>Do not commit violence.</li>
                <li>Do not use intoxicants.</li>
                <li>Do not speak a lie.</li>
                <li>Do not indulge in corrupt practices.</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>The Doctrine of Middle Path</h4>
              <p>
                It means that the man should avoid extremes of both a life of
                luxury and a life of severe asceticism and acquire a middle
                path. Also called
                <b>Madhya Marga</b> or <b> Madhayama Pratipada</b>.
              </p>

              <h4>Belief in Nirvana</h4>
              <p>
                Also known as moksha or salvation. It refers to a belief in the
                concept of ultimate bliss, whereby the person gets freedom from
                the cycle of birth and death.
              </p>
              <h3>The Three Jewels</h3>
              <p>
                All forms of Buddhism revere and take spiritual refuge in the
                "three jewels" (triratna): Buddha, Dharma and Sangha.
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Vardhamana is considered the 24th and last Tirthankara or
                  <b>Jina</b>. He came to be known as <b>Mahavira</b> (great
                  hero). He was also known by the names of
                  <b>Jitendriya</b> (one who has conquered his inner desires)
                  and <b>Arhant</b> (worthy).
                </li>
                <li>
                  According to tradition, he was a contemporary of the Buddha
                  and was born in c. 599 BCE at a village named Kundagrama near
                  Vaishali (capital of Videha).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Like the Buddha, he was born in a Kshatriya clan. His father
                  Siddhartha was the chief of the Jnatjriya clan and his mother
                  Trishala was lichchhavi princess and sister of Vajji
                  (vaishali) King Chetaka. His family was connected with the
                  royal family of Magadha, as Chetaka’s daughter was married to
                  Bimbisara (Haryanka Dynasty of Magadha).
                </li>

              <h3>Teachings of Mahavira</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Rejected the authority of the Vedas and did not believe in
                  existence of God.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He believed that every object possesses a soul, so he
                  professed strict non-violence.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Attainment of salvation by believing in penance and dying of
                  starvation.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Universal brotherhood (equality) and non-belief in caste
                  system.
                </li>
                <li>He believed in karma and transmigration of soul.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Main Principles</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Non-violence (ahimsa):</b> The principle of ahimsa
                  (non-violence or non-injury) is a fundamental tenet of
                  Jainism. It holds that one must abandon all violent activity
                  and that without such a commitment to non-violence all
                  religious behavior is worthless.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Many-sided reality (anekantavada)</b>: The second main
                  principle of Jainism is anekantavada. This doctrine states
                  that truth and reality are complex and always have multiple
                  aspects.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Non-attachment (aparigraha):</b> The third main principle
                  in Jainism is aparigraha which means non-attachment to worldly
                  possessions. For monks and nuns, Jainism requires a vow of
                  complete non-possession of any property, relations and
                  emotions.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Five duties or Vows of Jainism (Pancho Mahavratas)</h3>
              <p>
                Jainism teaches five ethical duties, which it calls five vows.
                These are called anuvratas (small vows) for Jain laypersons, and
                mahavratas (great vows) for Jain mendicants.
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>Non-injury (Ahimsa).</li>
                <li>Non-lying (Satya).</li>
                <li>Non-stealing (Asteya).</li>
                <li>Non-possession (Aparigraha).</li>
                <li>Observing celibacy (Brahmacharya).</li>
              </ol>
              <h3>Sects of Jainism</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  After the death of Mahavira, during the reign of king
                  Chandragupta Maurya, a severe famine led to a great exodus of
                  Jaina monks from Ganga valley to the deccan. This migration
                  led to a great schism in Jainism.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Bhadrabahu</b>, who led the emigrants, insisted that
                  complete nudity is an essential practice of Jainism as per
                  Mahaviras teachings. His followers established the sect called
                  <b>Digambaras</b> (“Sky Clad”).
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Sthulabhadra</b>, the leader of the group, who remained in
                  the North allowed his followers to wear white garments. This
                  sect is called as the <b>Svetambaras</b> (“Iron Clad”).
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Spread of Jainisim</h3>
              <p>
                In later times, Jainism was chiefly concentrated in two regions:
                Gujarat and Rajasthan-Svetambara sect, Mysore—Digambara sect.
              </p>

              <h3>Jain Literature</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The sacred texts of Jainism were compiled in 6th century AD at
                  Vallabhi (Gujarat). They are written in
                  <b>Prakrit language</b> (Ardhumagadhi Prakrit).
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Jain literature (of Shvetambaras) is classified as
                  follows:
                </li>
                <ul>
                  <li>The twelve Angas</li>
                  <li>The twelve Upangas</li>
                  <li>The ten Parikarnas</li>
                  <li>The six Chhedasutras</li>
                  <li>The four Mulasutras.</li>
                </ul>
