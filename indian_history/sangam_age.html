              <h2>The Megalithic phase of South India</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The Neolithic phase of south India, which was highlighted by
                  the use of polished stone axe and blade tools, was succeeded
                  by the
                  <b>Megalithic phase</b> (around 1200 BCE–300 BCE).
                </li>
                <li>
                  The upper portions of the peninsula were inhabited by people
                  who were called the <b>Megalith builders</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Megaliths</b> are the graves, that were encircled with
                  mega/big pieces of stones and were, in most cases, located
                  outside the settlement area. Megaliths have been found in all
                  upland areas of the peninsula, but their concentration is more
                  in eastern Andhra and in Tamil Nadu.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Prominent sites that have yielded Megalithic burials include
                  <b>Brahmagiri, Maski</b> (Karnataka),
                  <b> Adichallanur</b> (Tamilnadu) etc.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It is highly likely that the Cholas, the Pandyas, and the
                  Keralaputras (Cheras) mentioned in the Ashokan inscriptions
                  probably belonged to the last phase of Megalithic culture.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Megalithic period in south India was followed by the
                  Sangam age.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h2>The Sangam Age: Three Early Kingdoms</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <h3>The Pandyas (Emblem - Fish)</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The Pandyas were first mentioned by <b>Megasthanese</b>. who
                  said that their kingdom was <b>famous for pearls</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Pandyan territory had its <b>capital at Madurai</b>,
                  situated on the banks of Vaigai river.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Pandya king (Neduncheliyan) profited from trade with Roman
                  Empire.
                </li>
                <li>
                  According to mythology, the curse of the Kannagi, wife of
                  Kovalan, burnt and destroyed Madurai.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>The Cholas (Emblem - Tiger)</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The Chola kingdom called as
                  <b>Cholamandulam/Coromandel</b> was situated to the north-east
                  of Pandya kingdom between Pennar and Vellar rivers.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Chola kingdom corresponded to modern Tanjore and
                  Tiruchirapalli districts. Its inland capital was
                  <b>Uraiyaur</b> a place famous for cotton trade.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Puhar</b> identical with Kaveripattanam was the main port
                  of Cholas and served as alternative capital of Cholas.
                </li>
                <li>
                  They maintained an efficient navy. The Cholas were wiped out
                  in the attack of Pallavas from North.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                <b>Note:</b> Sangam age cholas were different from the Cholas of
                9th Century AD (called the Imperial Cholas).
              </p>
              <h3>The Cheras (Emblem - Bow)</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The Chera country occupied the portion of both Kerala and
                  Tamil Nadu.
                </li>
                <li>The capital of Cheras was <b>Vanjji</b>.</li>
                <li>
                  It main ports were <b>Muzris and Tondi</b>. The Romans set up
                  two regiment at Muzris (identical with Cranganore) in Chera
                  country. They also built a temple of Augustus at Muzris.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Senguttuvan (2nd century CE) was the prominent ruler of the
                  Chera dynasty. The military achievements of Senguttuvan have
                  been recorded in the epic Silappathikaram, which talks about
                  his Himalayan expedition where he vanquished many rulers from
                  northern India.

                The Sangam literature deals with the history, politics, wars,
                and culture of the Tamil people of this period. The scholars of
                the Sangam period rose from among the common people who sought
                the patronage of the Tamil Kings, but who mainly wrote about the
                common people and their concerns. Unlike Sanskrit writers who
                were mostly Brahmins, Sangam writers came from diverse classes
                and social backgrounds and were mostly non-Brahmins. They
                belonged to different faiths and professions such as farmers,
                artisans, merchants, monks, and priests, including also royalty
                and women.

                <p>
                  Kannagi and Kovalan are a newly married couple, living in a
                  flourishing seaport city of the early Chola kingdom. Over
                  time, Kovalan meets Madhavi – a courtesan. He falls for her
                  and leaves Kannagi. Later, realising his mistake, kovalan
                  returns to Kannagi. She takes him back.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Kannagi and Kovalan leave the city and travel to Madurai of
                  the Pandya kingdom. Kovalan is penniless and destitute.
                  Kannagi encourages her husband to rebuild their life together
                  and gives him one of her jeweled anklets to sell. Kovalan
                  sells it to a merchant, but the merchant falsely frames him as
                  having stolen the anklet from the queen. The king arrests
                  Kovalan and then executes him, without the due checks and
                  processes of justice.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When Kovalan does not return home, Kannagi goes searching for
                  him. She learns what has happened. She protests the injustice
                  and then proves Kovalan's innocence by throwing in the court
                  the other jeweled anklet of the pair. The king accepts his
                  mistake. Kannagi curses the king and the people of Madurai.
                  The king dies. The society that had made her suffer, suffers
                  in retribution as the city of Madurai is burnt to the ground
                  because of her curse.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the third section of the epic, gods and goddesses meet
                  Kannagi and she goes to heaven. The royal family of the Chera
                  kingdom learns about her, resolves to build a temple with
                  Kannagi as the featured goddess. They go to the Himalayas,
                  bring a stone, carve her image, call her goddess Pattini and
                  dedicate a temple for her.
