              <p>
                The period between c.200 BCE-300 CE saw a series of invasions
                and the rise of many regional kingdoms. The economy saw an
                <b> increasing use of currency</b>.
              </p>
              <h2>Foreign States</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <h3>The Indo-Greeks</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  A series of invasions began in about 200 BC. The weak Mauryan
                  king failed to restrict them. The first to invade India were
                  the Indo Greeks, who ruled Bactria (lying South of the Oxus
                  river and to the north-west of the Hindu Kush mountains) in
                  the area covered by North Afghanistan. They occupied a large
                  portion of North-Western India.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The most famous Indo-Greek ruler was <b>Menander</b> or
                  <b>Milinda</b>. He had his capital at Sagala (modern-day
                  Sialkot in Pakistan Punjab) He was converted to Buddhism by
                  <b>Nagasena</b>. Menander and Nagasena’s conversation were
                  recorded in the book <b>Milindapanho</b> or ‘the questions of
                  Milinda.’
                </li>
                <li>
                  They were the first rulers in India to issue coins attributed
                  to the kings. They were also
                  <b> first to issue gold coins</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Greek rule introduced features of
                  <b>Hellinistic art</b> in the North-West frontier of India,
                  visible in the Gandhara art.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Sanskrit term for astrology <b>Horshastra</b> is derived
                  from the Greek term horoscope.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>The Shakas or Scythians (AD 1st to 4th Century)</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The Greeks were followed by the Shakas, who originally
                  belonged to Central Asia.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A king of Ujjain, who called himself
                  <b>Vikramaditya</b> defeated Shakas. An era called the
                  <b>Vikram Samvat</b> is recorded from the event of his victory
                  over the Shakas <b>i.e., 57-56 BC</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The most famous Shaka ruler in India was <b>Rudradaman</b>. He
                  repaired the Sudarshan lake in the semi-arid zone of Kathiawar
                  and issued the first ever longest inscription in Sanskrit at
                  Junagarh.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Shaka rule started declining after their defeat at the
                  hands of the Satavahana ruler Gautamiputra Satakarni.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>The Parthians (AD 1st to 3rd Century)</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Originally, the Parthians lived in <b>Iran</b>, from where
                  they moved to India and replaced Shakas.
                </li>
                <li>
                  They occupied only a small portion of North-Western India as
                  compared to the Greeks and Shakas.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The most famous Parthian king was <b>Gondophernes</b>, in
                  whose reign
                  <b>St Thomas the Apostle</b>
                  came to India (Kerala, 52AD) for the propagation of
                  Christianity.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>The Kushanas (AD 1st to 3rd Century)</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The Kushanas (Yuechis) replaced the Greeks and Parthians. They
                  were nomadic people from steppes of <b>North Central Asia</b>.
                </li>
                <li>Kushanas issued gold coins on a large scale.</li>
                <li><b>Kanishka (AD 78-101)</b></li>
                <ul style="list-style-type: square">
                  <li>
                    He was the most famous Kushana ruler. He had two capitals–<b
                      >Purushpura</b
                    >
                    (present day Peshawar, Pakistan) and <b>Mathura</b> (in UP).
                  </li>

                    Presumably the ascension of Kanishka started an era in
                    <b>AD 78</b>, which is now known as
                    <b>Shaka era</b> (although Kanishka was not a Shaka, but a
                    Kushana ruler). It was adopted as the era of the Indian
                    national calendar (also known as "Saka calendar") in 1957
                    but not widely used.

                  The Shaka-Kushana phase registered a distinct advance in
                  building activities. The use of burnt brick for flooring and
                  that of tiles for both flooring and roofing, construction of
                  brick well and red ware pottery became prevalent.

                  They introduced better cavalry and tunic, trousers and long
                  heavy coat and also. They also brought cap, helmets, and
                  boots, which were used by warriors. The Kushanas were the
                  first rulers in India to issue gold coins on such a wide

                  Kanishka controlled the famous <b>silk route</b> in Central

              <ul>
                <li>
                  The successors of Ashoka were weak kings, so Mauryan empire
                  gradually declined. The last ruler of Mauryan dynasty,
                  <b>Brihadartha</b> was killed by his own commander-in-Chief
                  <b>Pushyamitra Shunga</b> who founded the Shunga dynasty.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He is considered to be the <b>persecutor of Buddhism</b>.
                  However, the Buddhist Stupa at Bharhut was renovated during
                  his reign. A gateway railing surrounding the Sanchi Stupa was
                  built during this period.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Shungas marked as the revival of Hindu culture, Sanskrit
                  language and Bhagavatism.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Shunga king <b>Agnimitra</b> was hero of
                  <b>Kalidasa’s Malvikagnimitram.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  The great Sanskrit Grammarian, <b>Patanjali</b> was patronised
                  by them.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The famous book on Hindu Law
                  <b>Manusmriti was compiled during this period</b>.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Kanva Dynasty (73 BC-28 BC)</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Kanva was a minor dynasty founded by <b>Vasudeva</b>, who
                  killed the last Shunga king <b>Devabhuti</b>. Its capital was
                  at <b> Pataliputra</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The last ruler, <b>Susarman</b>, was killed by Andhra king
                  (Satavahanas) <b>Simuka</b>.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>The Satavahana Dynasty (60 BC -225 AD)</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The Satavahanas are considered to be identical with the
                  Andhra, who are mentioned in the Puranas. The earliest
                  inscriptions of the Satavahanas belong to the first century
                  BC, when they defeated the Kanvas and established their power
                  in parts of Central India.
                </li>
                <li>
                  They were successors of Mauryas in the Deccan and Central
                  India. Satavahana rulers called themselves Brahmins.
                  Gautamiputra Satkarni boasted that he was a true Brahmin. They
                  performed Vedic rituals and worshipped Gods like Krishna,
                  Vasudeva and others.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The founder of this empire was Simuka, after the assassination
                  of last Kanava King Susarman. It is also pertinent to note
                  that the early Satavahana kings appeared not in Andhra but in
                  north Maharashtra (the fertile basin of the upper Godavari
                  valley), where their earliest coins and inscriptions have been
                  found. Gradually, they extended their power over Karnataka and
                  Andhra.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Their greatest competitors were the Shaka Kshatrapas of
                  Western India, who had established themselves in the upper
                  Deccan and western India.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Gautamiputra Satakarni (AD 106-130) was the greatest ruler of
                  this dynasty. Assumed the title of raja-raja and maharaja. His
                  capital was at <b>Paithan</b> or Pratisthan on the banks of
                  the river Godavari in Aurangabad district.
                </li>
                <li>
                  According to the Junagadh Inscription, Vasishthiputra Sri
                  Satkarni, the 24th ruler, married the daughter of Saka Satrap
                  Rudradaman, but was twice defeated by him.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Yajna Sri Satkarni (AD 165-194), the later king of
                  Satavahanas, ‘recovered North Konkan and Malwa from Shaka
                  rulers. His coins figured ‘ship with double mast’. Pulamayi
                  III was the last Satavahana ruler, succeeded by Ikshavakus in
                  the 3rd century BC.

                    They issued mostly lead coins (apart from copper and
                    bronze). Satavahanas were the first rulers to make land
                    grants to Brahmins. There is an instance of grants being
                    made to Buddhist monk, which shows they also promoted
                    Buddhism.

                    Stupas at Nagarjuna konda and Amaravati in Andhra Pradesh
                    became important seats of Buddhist culture under the
                    Satavahanas.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    In the Satavahana phase, many chaityas e.g., Karle caves in
                    Western deccan, Nashik and Kanheri and Viharas were cut out
                    of solid rocks in the North-Western Deccan. The official
                    language of Satavahanas was Prakrit and the script was
                    Brahmi.

                  <li>
