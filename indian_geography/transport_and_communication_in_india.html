              <p>
                Transport and Communication serves as lifelines of a nation and
                plays an integral role in the economy of a nation. The use of
                transport and communication depends upon our need to move things
                from place of their availability to the place of their use. We
                use various methods to move goods, commodities, ideas from one
                place to another.

              <h3>Roadways</h3>
              <p>
                India has one of the largest road networks in the world. In
                India, roads are classified in the following six classes
                according to their capacity.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Golden Quadrilateral Super Highways:</b> is a major road
                  development project linking Delhi-Kolkata-Chennai-Mumbai and
                  Delhi by six-lane Super Highways. The North-South corridors
                  linking Srinagar (Jammu & Kashmir) and Kanniyakumari (Tamil
                  Nadu), and East-West Corridor connecting Silchar (Assam) and
                  Porbander (Gujarat) are part of this project. The major
                  objective of these Super Highways is to reduce the time and
                  distance between the mega cities of India. These highway
                  projects are being implemented by the National Highway
                  Authority of India (NHAI).
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>National Highways:</b> are constructed and maintained by
                  the Central Government and they link extreme parts of the
                  country. National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) is
                  entrusted with the development, maintenance and operation of
                  National Highways. The historical Sher-Shah Suri Marg is
                  called National Highway No.1, between Delhi and Amritsar.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>State Highways</b> are constructed and maintained by state
                  governments. They join the state capitals with district
                  headquarters and other important towns. These roads are
                  connected to the National Highways. These roads are
                  constructed and maintained by the State Public Works
                  Department (PWD) in State and Union Territories.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>District Roads</b> are the connecting link between District
                  Headquarters and the other important nodes in the district.
                  These roads are maintained by the Zila Parishad.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Rural Roads</b> link rural areas and villages with towns.
                  These roads received special impetus under the Pradhan Mantri
                  Grameen Sadak Yojana. Under this scheme special provisions are
                  made so that every village in the country is linked to a major
                  town in the country by an all season motorable road.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Border Roads:</b> Apart from these, Border Roads
                  Organisation, a Government of India undertaking, constructs
                  and maintains roads in the bordering areas of the country.
                  This organisation was established in 1960 for the development
                  of the roads of strategic importance in the northern and
                  north-eastern border areas. These roads have improved
                  accessibility in areas of difficult terrain and have helped in
                  the economic development of these area.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <div class="note">
                <p>
                  National Highway 44 (NH 44) is the longest highway in the
                  country running over 3,806 km (2,365 mi) from Srinagar to
                  Kanyakumari. It came into being by merging seven national
                  highways including National Highway-7, the previous longest
                  highway between Varanasi and Kanyakumari via Jabalpur, Nagpur,
                  Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Madurai.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Roads can also be classified on the basis of the type of
                  material used for their construction such as metalled and
                  unmetalled roads. Metalled roads may be made of cement,
                  concrete or even bitumen of coal, therefore, these are all
                  weather roads. Unmetalled roads go out of use in the rainy
                  season.

              <h3>Railways</h3>
              <p>
                Railways are the principal mode of transportation for freight
                and passengers in India. Indian Railways have been a great
                integrating force for more than 150 years by binding the
                economic life of the country as well as accelerating the
                development of the industry and agriculture. The first train
                steamed off from Mumbai to Thane in 1853, covering a distance of
                34 km.
              </p>
              <p>
                Its very large size puts lots of pressure on a centralised
                railway management system. Thus, in India, the railway system
                has been divided into sixteen zones.

                  On the basis of width of the track of Indian Railways, three
                  categories have been made:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <b>Broad gauge:</b> The distance between rails in broad
                    gauge is 1.676 metre.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Metre gauge:</b> The distance between rails is one metre.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Narrow gauge:</b> The distance between the rails in this
                    case is 0.762 metre or 0.610 metre.

                  Railway continues to remain the main means of transport for
                  the masses. Railway network is relatively less dense in the
                  hill states, north eastern states, central parts of India and
                  Rajasthan.
                </p>
                <h3>Pipelines</h3>
                <p>
                  Pipeline transport network is a new arrival on the
                  transportation map of India. In the past, these were used to
                  transport water to cities and industries. Now, these are used
                  for transporting crude oil, petroleum products and natural gas
                  from oil and natural gas fields to refineries, fertilizer
                  factories and big thermal power plants. Solids can also be
                  transported through a pipeline when converted into slurry.
                  Initial cost of laying pipelines is high but subsequent
                  running costs are minimal. It rules out trans-shipment losses
                  or delays.

                <h3>Waterways</h3>
                <p>
                  Waterways is an important mode of transport for both passenger
                  and cargo traffic in India. It is the cheapest means of
                  transport and is most suitable for carrying heavy and bulky
                  material. It is a fuel-efficient and eco-friendly mode of
                  transport. The water transport is of two types–

                    <b>Inland Waterways:</b> It comprises rivers, canals,
                    backwaters, creeks, etc. For the development, maintenance
                    and regulation of national waterways in the country, the
                    Inland Waterways Authority was set up in 1986. The authority
                    has declared following inland waterways as National
                    Waterways.

                    <b>Oceanic Waterways:</b> India has a vast coastline of
                    approximate 7,517 km, including islands. Twelve major and
                    185 minor ports provide infrastructural support to these
                    routes. Oceanic routes play an important role in the
                    transport sector of India’s economy. Approximately 95 per
                    cent of India’s foreign trade by volume and 70 per cent by
                    value moves through ocean routes. Apart from international
                    trade, these are also used for the purpose of transportation
                    between the islands and the rest of the country.

                <p>
                  The air travel, today, is the fastest, most comfortable and
                  prestigious mode of transport. It can cover very difficult
                  terrains like high mountains, dreary deserts, dense forests
                  and also long oceanic stretches with great ease. In
                  north-eastern part of the country, marked with the presence of
                  big rivers, dissected relief, dense forests and frequent
                  floods and international frontiers, etc., Air travel has made
                  access easier.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The air transport was nationalised in 1953. On the operational
                  side, Indian Airlines, Alliance Air (subsidiary of Indian
                  Airlines), private scheduled airlines and non- scheduled
                  operators provide domestic air services. Air India provides
                  international air services. Pawanhans Helicopters Ltd.
                  provides helicopter services to Oil and Natural Gas
                  Corporation in its off-shore operations, to inaccessible areas
                  and difficult terrains like the north-eastern states and the
                  interior parts of Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and
                  Uttarakhand. Indian Airlines operations also extend to the
                  neighbouring countries of South and south-east Asia and the
                  Middle east.

                <p>
                  Air travel is not within the reach of the common people. It is
                  only in the north-eastern states that special provisions are
                  made to extend the services to the common people.

                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>
                  Human beings have evolved different methods of communication
                  over time. In earlier times, the messages were delivered by
                  beating the drum or hollow tree trunks, giving indications
                  through smoke or fire or with the help of fast runners.
                  Horses, camels, dogs, birds and other animals were also used
                  to send messages. Initially, the means of communication were
                  also the means of transportation. Invention of post-office,
                  telegraph, printing press, telephone, satellite, etc has made
                  the communication much faster and easier. Development in the
                  field of science and technology has significantly contributed
                  in bringing about revolution in the field of communication.
                </p>
                <p>
                  People use different modes of communication to convey the
                  messages. On the basis of scale and quality, the mode of
                  communication can be divided into following categories:
