              <h1 class="title">Wildlife in India</h1>
              <p>
                Wildlife of India is a great natural heritage. It contains three
                of the world’s 36
                <a href='/physical_geography/bio_diversity#biodiversity-hotspot'><b> biodiversity hotspots</b></a
                >
                - the Western Ghats, the Eastern Himalayas, and the Indo-Burma
                hotspot. It is one of the seventeen megadiverse countries. It
                has seven Natural World Heritage sites, twelve of the eighteen
                biosphere Reserves of India are in the World Network of
                Biosphere Reserves and India has thirty seven Ramsar Wetlands.
              </p>
              <p>
                With its various ecosystems ranging from the Himalayas in the
                north to the evergreen rain forests in the south, the desert
                sands of the west to the marshy mangroves of the east.
              </p>
              <p>
                India is home to about 7.6% of mammal, 14.7% of amphibian, 6% of
                bird, 6.2% of reptilian, and 6.0% of flowering plant species.
                India's forest lands nurture about 500 species of mammals and
                2000+ bird species. It is estimated that about 4-5 per cent of
                all known plant and animal species on the earth are found in
                India.
              </p>
              <p>
                The main reason for this remarkable diversity of life forms is
                the great diversity of the ecosystem which this country has
                preserved and supported through the ages.
              </p>
              <h2>Fauna</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  India is home to several well-known large animals, including
                  the Indian elephant (National heritage animal) and Indian
                  rhinoceros. The elephants are the most majestic animals among
                  the mammals. They are found in the hot wet forests of Assam,
                  Karnataka and Kerala. One-horned rhinoceroses live in swampy
                  and marshy lands of Assam and West Bengal. Arid areas of the
                  Rann of Kachchh and the Thar Desert are the habitat for wild
                  ass and camels respectively.
                </li>
                <li>
                  India is home to big cats like Bengal tiger (National animal),
                  Asiatic and Indian lion, Indian leopard, snow leopard, and
                  clouded leopard. The natural habitat of the Indian lion is the
                  Gir forest in Gujarat. Tigers are found in the forests of
                  Madhya Pradesh, the Sundarbans of West Bengal and the
                  Himalayan region.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Himalayas harbour a hardy range of animals, which survive
                  in extreme cold. Ladakh’s freezing high altitudes are a home
                  to yak, the shaggy horned wild ox weighing around one tonne,
                  the Tibetan antelope, the bharal (blue sheep), wild sheep, and
                  the kiang (Tibetan wild ass). Furhtermore, the ibex, bear,
                  snow-leopard and rare red panda are found in certain pockets.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In the rivers, lakes and coastal areas, turtles, crocodiles
                  and gharials are found. The latter is the only representative
                  of a variety of crocodile, found in the world today.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Bears include sloth bear, the Himalayan black bear, the
                  Himalayan brown bear. Deer and Antelopes include the
                  chausinga(four-horned antelope), gazel, the blackbuck,
                  chinkara, chital, sambar (deer), Tibetan antelope, goa
                  (antelope), Kashmir stag, and the barasinga.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Various species of caprines, including Bhutan and Mishmi
                  takin, Himalayan and red goral, Himalayan serow, red serow,
                  Himalayan tahr, and Nilgiri tahr, as well as the kiang and
                  Indian wild ass can be found.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Reptiles include king cobra, Indian cobra, bamboo pit viper,
                  Sri Lankan green vine snake, Indian rock python, reticulated
                  python, mugger crocodile, gharial, saltwater crocodile and
                  Indian golden gecko.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Bird life in India is colourful. Birds include Indian peacock
                  (National bird), ducks, parakeets, cranes, pigeons, great
                  Indian hornbill, painted stork, greater and lesser flamingo,
                  and Eurasian spoonbill.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h2>Threat to Wildlife</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                Over the years, their habitat has been disturbed by human
                activities and as a result, their numbers have dwindled
                significantly. There are certain species that are at the brink
                of extinction.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some of the important reasons of the declining of wildlife are
                as follows:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Industrial and technological advancement brought about a rapid
                  increase in the exploitation of forest resources.
                </li>
                <li>
                  More and more lands were cleared for agriculture, human
                  settlement, roads, mining, reservoirs, etc.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Pressure on forests mounted due to lopping for fodder and
                  fuelwood and removal of small timber by the local people.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Grazing by domestic cattle caused an adverse effect on
                  wildlife and its habitat.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Trophy hunting was taken up as a sport by the elite and
                  hundreds of wild animals were killed and their lifeless-bodies
                  are collected as trophies. Now commercial poaching is rampant.
                </li>
                <li>Incidence of forest fire.</li>
              </ul>
              <h2>Wildlife Conservation in India</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                In 1972, a comprehensive <b>Wildlife (Protection) Act</b> was
                enacted, which provides the main legal framework for
                conservation and protection of wildlife in India. The two main
                objectives of the Act are;
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  to provide protection to the endangered species listed in the
                  schedule of the Act and
                </li>
                <li>
                  to provide legal support to the conservation areas of the
                  country classified as National parks, sanctuaries and closed
                  areas.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This Act has been comprehensively amended in 1991, making
                punishments more stringent and has also made provisions for the
                protection of specified plant species and conservation of
                endangered species of wild animals.
              </p>
              <p>
                For the purpose of effective conservation of flora and fauna,
                special steps have been initiated by the Government of India in
                collaboration with UNESCO’s ‘Man and Biosphere Programme’.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Special schemes like Project Tiger (1973) and Project Elephant
                  (1992) have been launched to conserve these species and their
                  habitat in a sustainable manner.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Apart from this, some other projects such as Crocodile
                  Breeding Project, Project Rhino, Project Great Indian Bustard,
                  Project Hangul and conservation of Himalayan Musk deer have
                  also been launched by the Government of India.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve (NBR) was the first biosphere
                  reserve of India, established in September 1986. Panna in
                  Madhya Pradesh is the newest declared Biosphere Reserve in
                  India (2011).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Most of the times biosphere reserves are named after the
                  National Park or Wildlife Sanctuary located in them. Ex:
                  Kangchenjunga Biosphere Reserve has Kangchenjunga National
                  Park, Manas Biosphere Reserve has Manas National park and
                  Manas Wildlife Sanctuary and so on.
                </li>

                  Great Rann of Kutch Biosphere Reserve in Gujarat is the
                  largest biosphere reserve in India.
