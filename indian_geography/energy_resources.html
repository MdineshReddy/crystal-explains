              <h1 class="title">Energy Resources in India</h1>
              <p>
                Mineral fuels are essential for generation of power, required by
                agriculture, industry, transport and other sectors of the
                economy.
              </p>
              <p>
                Energy can be generated from fuel minerals like coal, petroleum,
                natural gas, uranium and from electricity. Energy resources can
                be classified as conventional and non-conventional sources.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Conventional sources include: firewood, cattle dung cake,
                  coal, petroleum, natural gas and electricity (both hydel and
                  thermal).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Non-conventional sources include solar, wind, tidal,
                  geothermal, biogas and atomic energy.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Firewood and cattle dung cake are most common in rural India.
                According to one estimate more than 70 per cent energy
                requirement in rural households is met by these two;
                continuation of these is increasingly becoming difficult due to
                decreasing forest area. Moreover, using dung cake too is being
                discouraged because it consumes most valuable manure which could
                be used in agriculture.

              <h2>Conventional Energy Resources</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <h3>Coal</h3>
              <p>
                In India, coal is the most abundantly available fossil fuel. It
                provides a substantial part of the nation’s energy needs. It is
                used for power generation, to supply energy to industry as well
                as for domestic needs. Electricity from coal is called thermal
                power India is highly dependent on coal for meeting its
                commercial energy requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                Coal is formed due the compression of plant material over
                millions of years. Coal is therefore referred to as Buried
                Sunshine. Coal is found in a variety of forms depending on the
                degrees of compression and the depth and time of burial.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Decaying plants in swamps produce peat. Which has a low carbon
                  and high moisture contents and low heating capacity.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Lignite is a low grade brown coal, which is soft with high
                  moisture content. The principal lignite reserves are in
                  Neyveli in Tamil Nadu and are used for generation of
                  electricity.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Coal that has been buried deep and subjected to increased
                  temperatures is bituminous coal. It is the most popular coal
                  in commercial use. Metallurgical coal is high grade bituminous
                  coal which has a special value for smelting iron in blast
                  furnaces.
                </li>
                <li>Anthracite is the highest quality hard coal.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                Jharia and Bokaro in Jharkhand and Raniganj in West Bengal are
                important coalfields. Coal is a bulky material, which loses
                weight on use as it is reduced to ash. Hence, heavy industries
                and thermal power stations are located on or near the
                coalfields.
              </p>
              <div class="note">
                <h3 style="text-align: center">Thermal Power Generation</h3>
                <p>
                  In thermal power plants, the heat energy obtained from
                  combustion of solid fuel (mostly coal) is used to convert
                  water into steam, this steam is at high pressure and
                  temperature.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This steam is used to rotate the turbine blade whose shaft is
                  connected to the generator. The generator converts the kinetic
                  energy of the turbine impeller into electric energy.

              </div>
              <h3>Petroleum</h3>
              <p>
                Petroleum or mineral oil is the next major energy source in
                India after coal. It provides fuel for heat and lighting,
                lubricants for machinery and raw materials for a number of
                manufacturing industries. Petroleum refineries act as a “nodal
                industry” for synthetic textile, fertiliser and numerous
                chemical industries.
              </p>
              <p>
                Crude petroleum occurs in sedimentary rocks of the tertiary
                period. It is found between the layers of rocks and is drilled
                from oil fields located in off-shore and coastal areas. This is
                then sent to refineries which process the crude oil and produce
                a variety of products like diesel, petrol, kerosene, wax,
                plastics and lubricants. Petroleum and its derivatives are
                called Black Gold as they are very valuable.
              </p>

              <p>
                About 63 % of India’s petroleum production is from Mumbai High,
                18 % from Gujarat and 16 % from Assam. Digboi in Assam was the
                oldest oil producing region. Oil and natural gas have been found
                in exploratory wells in Krishna-Godavari
              </p>
              <h3>Natural Gas</h3>
              <p>
                Natural gas is an important clean energy resource found in
                association with or without petroleum and is released when crude
                oil is brought to the surface. It is used as a source of energy
                as well as an industrial raw material in the petrochemical
                industry.
              </p>

              <p>
                Large reserves of natural gas have been discovered in the
                Krishna-Godavari basin and Kaveri basin on the east coast. Along
                the west coast the reserves of the Mumbai High and allied fields
                are supplemented by finds in the Gulf of Cambay. Andaman and
                Nicobar islands are also important areas having large reserves
                of natural gas.
              </p>
              <p>
                Natural gas is considered an environment friendly fuel because
                of low carbon dioxide emissions and is, therefore, the fuel for
                the present century. The power and fertilizer industries are the
                key users of natural gas. Compressed Natural Gas (CNG ) for
                vehicles is an alternative to other liquid fuels.
              </p>
              <h3>Hydel Power</h3>
              <p>
                Rain water or river water stored in dams is made to fall from
                heights. The falling water flows through pipes inside the dam
                over turbine blades placed at the bottom of the dam. The moving
                blades then turn the generator to produce electricity. This is
                called hydro electricity.
              </p>
              <p>
                The water discharged after the generation of electricity is used
                for irrigation. One fourth of the world’s electricity is
                produced by hydel power. Some important hydel power stations in
                India are Bhakra Nangal, Gandhi Sagar, Nagarjunsagar and Damodar
                valley projects.
              </p>
              <h2>Non-Conventional Sources of Energy</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <h3>Solar Energy</h3>
              <p>
                India is a tropical country. It has enormous possibilities of
                tapping solar energy. Photovoltaic technology converts sunlight
                directly into electricity. Solar energy is fast becoming popular
                in rural and remote areas. Solar energy is absolutely pollution
                free, inexhaustible source of energy.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is generally used more in appliances like heaters, crop
                dryers, cookers, besides being used for community lighting and
                traffic signals etc. The western part of India has greater
                potential for the development of solar energy in Gujarat and
                Rajasthan.
              </p>
              <h3>Wind Power</h3>
              <p>
                Wind energy is also absolutely pollution free and an
                inexhaustible source of energy. The mechanism of energy
                conversion from blowing wind is simple. The kinetic energy of
                wind rotates the wind mill's turbine which is connected to a
                generator to produce electricity. Wind farms having clusters of
                such wind mills are located in coastal regions and in mountain
                passes where strong and steady winds blow.
              </p>
              <p>
                India has great potential of wind power. The largest wind farm
                cluster is located in Tamil Nadu from Nagarcoil to Madurai.
                Apart from these, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Gujarat, Kerala,
                Maharashtra and Lakshadweep have important wind farms.
              </p>
              <h3>Nuclear Energy</h3>
              <p>
                Nuclear power is obtained from energy stored in the nuclei of
                atoms of naturally occurring radio active elements like uranium
                and thorium. These fuels undergo nuclear fission in nuclear
                reactors and emit power. Uranium and Thorium, which are
                available in Jharkhand and the Aravalli ranges of Rajasthan. The
                Monazite sands of Kerala is also rich in Thorium.

                The nuclear power stations in India are located in Kalpakkam in
                Tamilnadu, Tarapur in Maharastra, Rawatbhata in Rajasthan,
                Narora in Uttar Pradesh and Kaiga in Karnataka

              <h3>Biogas</h3>
              <p>
                Organic waste such as dead plant and animal material, animal
                dung and kitchen waste can be converted into a gaseous fuel
                called biogas. The organic waste is decomposed by bacteria in
                biogas digesters to emit biogas which is essentially a mixture
                of methane and carbon dioxide.
              </p>
              <p>
                Biogas plants are set up at municipal, cooperative and
                individual levels. The plants using cattle dung are known as
                ‘Gobar gas plants’ in rural India. These provide twin benefits
                to the farmer in the form of energy and improved quality of
                manure.

              <h3>Tidal Energy</h3>
              <p>
                Oceanic tides can be used to generate electricity. Floodgate
                dams are built across inlets. During high tide water flows into
                the inlet and gets trapped when the gate is closed. After the
                tide falls outside the flood gate, the water retained by the
                floodgate flows back to the sea via a pipe that carries it
                through a power-generating turbine.
              </p>
              <p>
                In India the Gulf of Khambhat, the Gulf of Kuchchh in Gujarat on
                the western coast and Gangetic delta in Sunderban regions of
                West Bengal provide ideal conditions for utilising tidal energy.

              <h3>Geothermal Energy</h3>
              <p>
                Geo thermal energy refers to the heat and electricity produced
                by using the heat from the interior of the Earth. Geothermal
                energy exists because, the Earth grows progressively hotter with
                increasing depth. Groundwater in such areas absorbs heat from
                the rocks and becomes hot. It is so hot that when it rises to
                the earth’s surface, it turns into steam. This steam is used to
                drive turbines and generate electricity
              </p>
              <p>
                There are several hundred hot springs in India, which could be
                used to generate electricity. Two experimental projects have
                been set up in India to harness geothermal energy. One is
                located in the Parvati valley near Manikarn in Himachal Pradesh
                and the other is located in the Puga Valley, Ladakh.

              <h2>Conservation of Energy Resources</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                Energy is a basic requirement for economic development. Every
                sector of the national economy – agriculture, industry,
                transport, commercial and domestic – needs inputs of energy. The
                economic development plans implemented since Independence
                necessarily required increasing amounts of energy to remain
                operational. As a result, consumption of energy in all forms has
                been steadily rising all over the country.
              </p>
              <p>
                In this background, there is an urgent need to develop a
                sustainable path of energy development. Promotion of energy
                conservation and increased use of renewable energy sources are
                the twin planks of sustainable energy.
