              <h2>
                Technological and Institutional Agricultural Reforms Over the
                Years
              </h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                Indian agricultural economy was largely subsistence in nature
                before Independence. It had dismal performance in the first half
                of twentieth century. This period witnessed severe droughts and
                famines. During partition about one-third of the irrigated land
                in undivided India went to Pakistan. This reduced the proportion
                of irrigated area in Independent India.
              </p>
              <p>
                After Independence, the immediate goal of the Government was to
                increase foodgrains production by
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>switching over from cash crops to food crops;</li>
                <li>
                  intensification of cropping over already cultivated land; and
                </li>
                <li>
                  increasing cultivated area by bringing cultivable and fallow
                  land under plough.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Initially, this strategy helped in increasing foodgrains
                production. But agricultural production stagnated during late
                1950s. To overcome this problem, Intensive Agricultural District
                Programme (IADP) and Intensive Agricultural Area Programme
                (IAAP) were launched. But two consecutive droughts during
                mid-1960s resulted in food crisis in the country. Consequently,
                the foodgrains were imported from other countries.
              </p>
              <h3>Green Revolution</h3>
              <p>
                The Government of India embarked upon introducing agricultural
                reforms to improve Indian agriculture in the 1960s and 1970s.
                New seed varieties of wheat (Mexico) and rice (Philippines)
                known as high yielding varieties (HYVs) were available for
                cultivation by mid-1960s. India took advantage of this and
                introduced package technology comprising HYVs, along with
                chemical fertilizers in irrigated areas of Punjab, Haryana,
                Western Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat.
              </p>
              <p>
                Assured supply of soil moisture through irrigation was a basic
                pre-requisite for the success of this new agricultural
                technology. This strategy of agricultural development paid
                dividends instantly and increased the foodgrains production at
                very fast rate. This spurt of agricultural growth came to be
                known as <b>‘Green Revolution’</b>. This also gave fillip to the
                development of a large number of agro-inputs, agro-processing
                industries and small-scale industries.
              </p>
              <p>
                This strategy of agricultural development made the country
                self-reliant in foodgrain production. But green revolution was
                initially confined to irrigated areas only. This led to regional
                disparities in agricultural development in the country till the
                seventies, after which the technology spread to the Eastern and
                Central parts of the country.
              </p>
              <h3>1980s and 1990s</h3>
              <p>
                The Planning Commission of India focused its attention on the
                problems of agriculture in rainfed areas in 1980s. It initiated
                agro-climatic planning in 1988 to induce regionally balanced
                agricultural development in the country. It also emphasised the
                need for diversification of agriculture and harnessing of
                resources for development of dairy farming, poultry,
                horticulture, livestock rearing and aquaculture.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 1990s, a comprehensive land development programme was
                initiated, which included both institutional and technical
                reforms. Provision for crop insurance against drought, flood,
                cyclone, fire and disease, establishment of Grameen banks,
                cooperative societies and banks for providing loan facilities to
                the farmers at lower rates of interest were some important steps
                in this direction.
              </p>
              <h3>In Recent Times</h3>
              <p>
                Kissan Credit Card (KCC), Personal Accident Insurance Scheme
                (PAIS) are some other schemes introduced by the Government of
                India for the benefit of the farmers. Moreover, special weather
                bulletins and agricultural programmes for farmers were
                introduced on the radio and television. The government also
                announces minimum support price, remunerative and procurement
                prices for important crops to check the exploitation of farmers
                by speculators and middlemen.
              </p>
              <p>
                Despite all the measures and reforms, agriculture in India is
                plagued with many problems.
              </p>
              <h3>Problems of Indian Agriculture</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Dependence on Erratic Monsoon</b>: Irrigation covers only
                  about 33 per cent of the cultivated area in India. The crop
                  production in rest of the cultivated land directly depends on
                  rainfall. Even the areas receiving high annual rainfall
                  experience considerable fluctuations. Poor performance of
                  south-west Monsoon also adversely affects the supply of canal
                  water for irrigation. This makes them vulnerable to both
                  droughts and floods.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Low productivity</b>: The yield of the crops in the country
                  is low in comparison to the international level. Per hectare
                  output of most of the crops such as rice, wheat, cotton and
                  oilseeds in India is much lower than that of U.S.A., Russia
                  and Japan. Because of the very high pressure on the land
                  resources, the labour productivity in Indian agriculture is
                  also very low in comparison to international level. The vast
                  rainfed areas of the country, particularly drylands which
                  mostly grow coarse cereals, pulses and oilseeds have very low
                  yields.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b> Constraints of Financial Resources and Indebtedness: </b>
                  The inputs of modern agriculture are very expensive. This
                  resource intensive approach has become unmanageable for
                  marginal and small farmers as they have very meagre or no
                  saving to invest in agriculture. To tide over these
                  difficulties, most of such farmers have resorted to availing
                  credit from various institutions and money lenders. Crop
                  failures and low returns from agriculture have forced them to
                  fall in the trap of indebtedness.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b> Lack of Land Reforms: </b> Indian peasantry had been
                  exploited for a long time as there had been unequal
                  distribution of land. Among the three revenue systems
                  operational during British period i.e. Mahalwari, Ryotwari and
                  Zamindari, the last one was most exploitative for the
                  peasants. After independence, land reforms were accorded
                  priority, but these reforms were not implemented effectively
                  due to lack of strong political will. Most of the state
                  governments avoided taking politically tough decisions which
                  went against strong political lobbies of landlords. Lack of
                  implementation of land reforms has resulted in continuation of
                  inequitous distribution of cultivable land which is
                  detrimental to agricultural development.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b> Small Farm Size and Fragmentation of Landholdings: </b>
                  There are a large number of marginal and small farmers in the
                  country. The average size of land holding is shrinking further
                  under increasing population pressure. Furthermore, in India,
                  the land holdings are mostly fragmented. The small size
                  fragmented landholdings are uneconomic.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Lack of Commercialisation</b>: Most of the small and
                  marginal farmers grow foodgrains, which are meant for their
                  own family consumption. These farmers do not have enough land
                  resources to produce more than their requirement.
                  Modernisation and commercialisation of agriculture have
                  however, taken place in the irrigated areas.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b> Vast Under-employment: </b> There is a massive
                  under-employment in the agricultural sector in India,
                  particularly in the un-irrigated tracts. In these areas, there
                  is a seasonal unemployment ranging from 4 to 8 months. Even in
                  the cropping season work is not available throughout, as
                  agricultural operations are not labour intensive. Hence, the
                  people engaged in agriculture do not have the opportunity to
                  work round the year.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b> Degradation of Cultivable Land: </b> Large tracts of
                  agricultural land has lost its fertility due to alkalisation
                  and salinisation of soils and waterlogging. Excessive use of
                  chemicals such as insecticides and pesticides has led to their
                  concentration in toxic amounts in the soil profile. Leguminous
                  crops have been displaced from the cropping pattern in the
                  irrigated areas and duration of fallow has substantially
                  reduced owing to multiple cropping. This has obliterated the
                  process of natural fertilization such as nitrogen fixation.
                  Rainfed areas in humid and semi-arid tropics also experience
                  degradation of several types like soil erosion by water and
                  wind erosion which are often induced by human activities.

              <h2>Food Security</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                Food is a basic need and every citizen of the country should
                have access to food of minimum nutritional level. If any segment
                of our population does not have this access, that segment
                suffers from lack of food security.
              </p>
              <p>
                In order to ensure availability of food to all sections of
                society our government carefully designed a national food
                security system. It consists of two components (a) buffer stock
                and (b) public distribution system (PDS).
              </p>
              <p>
                India’s food security policy has a primary objective to ensure
                availability of foodgrains to the common people at an affordable
                price. It has enabled the poor to have access to food. The focus
                of the policy is on growth in agriculture production and on
                fixing the support price for procurement of wheat and rice, to
                maintain their stocks.
              </p>
              <p>
                Food Corporation of India (FCI) is responsible for procuring and
                stocking foodgrains, whereas distribution is ensured by public
                distribution system (PDS). PDS is a programme which provides
                food grains and other essential commodities at subsidised prices
                to Below Poverty Line (BPL) population in rural and urban areas.
              </p>
              <p>
                The FCI procures foodgrains from the farmers at the government
                announced minimum support price (MSP). The government used to
                provide subsidies on agriculture inputs such as fertilizers,
                power and water. These subsidies have now reached unsustainable
                levels and have also led to large scale inefficiencies in the
                use of these scarce inputs. Excessive and imprudent use of
                fertilizers and water has led to waterlogging, salinity and
                depletion of essential micronutrients in the soil. The high MSP,
                subsidies in input and committed FCI purchases have distorted
                the cropping pattern. Wheat and paddy crops are being grown more
                for the MSP they get. Punjab and Haryana are foremost examples.
                This has also created a serious imbalance in inter-crop
                parities.
              </p>
              <p>
                Even the categorisation between below poverty line (BPL) and
                above poverty line (APL), is not perfect and a number of
                deserving poor have been excluded from the BPL category.
                Moreover, some of the so called APL slip back to BPL, because of
                the failure of even one crop and it is administratively
                difficult to accommodate such shifts.
              </p>
              <p>
                Each district and block can be made self sufficient in foodgrain
                production if government provides proper agricultural
                infrastructure, credit linkages and also encourages the use of
                latest techniques. Instead of concentrating only on rice or
                wheat, the food crop with a better growth potential in that
                particular area must be encouraged. Creation of necessary
                infrastructure like irrigation facilities, availability of
                electricity etc. may also attract private investments in
                agriculture.
              </p>
              <p>
                The focus on increasing foodgrain production which should be on
                a sustainable basis and also free trade in grains will create
                massive employment and reduce poverty in rural areas.
