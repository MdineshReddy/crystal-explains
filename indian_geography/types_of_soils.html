              <h1 class="title">Types of Soils in India</h1>
              <p>
                Soil is the most important renewable natural resource. It is the
                medium of plant growth and supports different types of living
                organisms on the earth.
              </p>
              <p>
                The soil is a living system. It takes millions of years to form
                soil upto a few cm in depth. Relief, parent rock or bed rock,
                climate, vegetation and other forms of life and time are
                important factors in the formation of soil. Various forces of
                nature such as change in temperature, actions of running water,
                wind and glaciers, activities of decomposers etc. contribute to
                the formation of soil. Chemical and organic changes which take
                place in the soil are equally important. Soil also consists of
                organic (humus) and inorganic materials.

              <h2>Classification of Soils</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <b>
                On the basis of proportion of particles of various sizes, soil
                is classified as sandy, clayey and loamy.
              </b>
              <ul style="margin: 0">
                <li>
                  If soil contains greater proportion of big particles it is
                  called sandy soil.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If the proportion of fine particles is relatively higher, then
                  it is called clayey soil.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If the amount of large and fine particles is about the same,
                  then the soil is called loamy.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <div class="img">
                <img
                  src="../images/geography/types_of_soils.jpg"
                  alt="Soil Types"

                />
              </div>
              <p>
                The size of the particles in a soil has an influence on its
                properties. Sand particles are quite large. They cannot fit
                close together, so there are large spaces between them. These
                spaces are filled with air. We say that the sand is well
                aerated. Water can drain quickly through the spaces between the
                sand particles. So, sandy soils tend to be light, well aerated
                and rather dry. Clay particles, being much smaller, pack tightly
                together, leaving little space for air. Unlike sandy soil, water
                can be held in the tiny gaps between the particles of clay. So
                clayey soils have less air. But they are heavy as they hold more
                water than the sandy soils.
              </p>
              <p>
                The best topsoil for growing plants is loam. Loamy soil is a
                mixture of sand, clay and another type of soil particle known as
                silt. Silt occurs as a deposit in riverbeds. The size of the
                silt particles is between those of sand and clay. The loamy soil
                also has humus in it. It has the right water holding capacity
                for the growth of plants.
              </p>
              <b>
                On the basis of the factors responsible for soil formation,
                colour, thickness, texture, age, chemical and physical
                properties, the soils of India are classified into different
                types.
              </b>
              <p>
                In India, the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) has
                classified soils into 8 categories:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>Alluvial Soil,</li>
                <li>Black Soil or regur soils or Black Cotton Soil,</li>
                <li>Red and Yellow Soils,</li>
                <li>Laterite Soil,</li>
                <li>Arid or Desert Soil,</li>
                <li>Mountainous or Forest Soils,</li>
                <li>Saline or Alkaline Soil,</li>
                <li>Peaty or Marshy Soil.</li>
              </ol>
              <h3>Alluvial Soils</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Alluvial soils are soils deposited by surface water. This is
                  the most widely spread and important soil. In fact, the entire
                  northern plains are made of alluvial soil. These have been
                  deposited by three important Himalayan river systems– the
                  Indus, the Ganga and the Brahmaputra.
                </li>
                <li>
                  These soils also extend in Rajasthan and Gujarat through a
                  narrow corridor. Alluvial soil is also found in the eastern
                  coastal plains particularly in the deltas of the Mahanadi, the
                  Godavari, the Krishna and the Kaveri rivers.
                </li>
                <li>
                  According to their age alluvial soils can be classified as old
                  alluvial (Bangar) and new alluvial (Khadar). The bangar soil
                  has higher concentration of kanker nodules than the Khadar.
                  Khadar has more fine particles and is more fertile than the
                  bangar.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The alluvial soils vary in nature from sandy loam to clay.
                  They are rich in potash but poor in phosphorous.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Alluvial soils as a whole are very fertile and are ideal for
                  majority of crops including sugarcane, paddy, wheat and other
                  cereal and pulse crops.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Black Soil</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  These soils are black in colour and are also known as regur
                  soils. Black soil is ideal for growing cotton and is also
                  known as black cotton soil.
                </li>
                <li>
                  This type of soil is typical of the Deccan trap (Basalt)
                  region spread over northwest Deccan plateau and is made up of
                  lava flows. They cover the plateaus of Maharashtra,
                  Saurashtra, Malwa, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh and extend
                  in the south east direction along the Godavari and the Krishna
                  valleys.
                </li>
                <li>
                  They are generally clayey and develop deep cracks during hot
                  weather, which helps in the proper aeration of the soil. Thus
                  there occurs a kind of 'self ploughing'. These soils are
                  sticky when wet and difficult to work on unless tilled
                  immediately after the first shower or during the pre-monsoon
                  period.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Chemically, they are rich in lime, iron, magnesia and alumina.
                  They also contain potash but lack in phosphorous.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Red and Yellow Soils</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Red soil develops on crystalline igneous rocks in areas of low
                  rainfall in the eastern and southern parts of the Deccan
                  plateau. Yellow and red soils are also found in parts of
                  Odisha, Chhattisgarh, southern parts of the middle Ganga plain
                  and along the piedmont zone of the Western Ghats.
                </li>
                <li>
                  These soils develop a reddish colour due to diffusion of iron
                  in crystalline and metamorphic rocks. It looks yellow when it
                  occurs in a hydrated form. They are generally poor in
                  nitrogen, phosphorous and humus.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Laterite Soil</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Laterite has been derived from the Latin word ‘later’ which
                  means brick. The laterite soil develops under tropical and
                  subtropical climate with alternate wet and dry season.
                </li>
                <li>
                  This soil is the result of intense leaching due to heavy rain.
                  Lateritic soils are mostly deep to very deep, acidic (pH less
                  than 6.0), generally deficient in plant nutrients and occur
                  mostly in southern states, Western Ghats region of
                  Maharashtra, Odisha, some parts of West Bengal and North-east
                  regions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It is generally humus poor. They are prone to erosion and
                  degradation due to their position on the landscape. After
                  adopting appropriate soil conservation techniques particularly
                  in the hilly areas of Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, this
                  soil is very useful for growing tea and coffee. Red laterite
                  soils in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala are more
                  suitable for crops like cashew nut.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Arid or Desert Soils</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Arid soils range from red to brown in colour. They are
                  generally sandy in texture and saline in nature. In some areas
                  the salt content is very high and common salt is obtained by
                  evaporating the water.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Due to the dry climate, high temperature, evaporation is
                  faster and the soil lacks humus and moisture.
                </li>
                <li>
                  They lack moisture and humus. Nitrogen is insufficient and the
                  phosphate content is normal. The lower horizons of the soil
                  are occupied by Kankar because of the increasing calcium
                  content downwards. The Kankar layer formations in the bottom
                  horizons restrict the infiltration of water.

                <li>
                  After proper irrigation these soils become cultivable as has
                  been in the case of western Rajasthan.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Mountainous or Forest Soils</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  These soils are found in the hilly and mountainous areas where
                  sufficient rain forests are available.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The soils texture varies according to the mountain environment
                  where they are formed. They are loamy and silty in valley
                  sides and coarse grained in the upper slopes. In the snow
                  covered areas of Himalayas, these soils experience denudation
                  and are acidic with low humus content. The soils found in the
                  lower parts of the valleys particularly on the river terraces
                  and alluvial fans are fertile.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Saline or Alkaline Soil</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Alkaline, soils are clay soils with high pH (> 8.5), a poor
                  soil structure and a low infiltration capacity. Often they
                  have a hard calcareous layer at 0.5 to 1 metre depth. Alkaline
                  soils are basic, but not all basic soils are alkaline.
                </li>
                <li>
                  They contain a large proportion of sodium, potassium and
                  magnesium, which hinders plant growth. Alkaline soils are
                  difficult to take into agricultural production. Due to the low
                  infiltration capacity, rain water stagnates on the soil easily
                  and, in dry periods, cultivation is hardly possible without
                  copious irrigated water and good drainage. Agriculture is
                  limited to crops tolerant to surface waterlogging (e.g. rice,
                  grass) and the productivity is lower.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Peaty or Marshy Soils</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Peaty soils are found in areas of heavy rainfall and high
                  humidity, where there is a good growth of vegetation. Thus,
                  large quantity of dead organic matter accumulated in these
                  areas, and this gives a rich humus and organic content to the
                  soil. The soils are black and heavy.
