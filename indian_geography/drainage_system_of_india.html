              <h1 class="title">Drainage System of India</h1>
              <p>
                The flow of water through well-defined channels is known as
                <b>‘drainage’</b> and the network of such channels is called a
                <b>‘drainage system’</b>. An area drained by a river and its
                tributaries is called a <b>drainage basin</b>. The drainage
                pattern of an area is the outcome of the geological time period,
                nature and structure of rocks, topography, slope, amount of
                water flowing and the periodicity of the flow.
              </p>
              <h3>Drainage Patterns</h3>
              <p>
                The streams within a drainage basin form certain patterns,
                depending on the slope of land, underlying rock structure as
                well as the climatic conditions of the area. These are:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Dendritic Drainage Pattern</b>: The dendritic pattern
                  develops where the river channel follows the slope of the
                  terrain. The stream with its tributaries resembles the
                  branches of a tree, thus the name dendritic.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Trellis Drainage Pattern:</b> A river joined by its
                  tributaries, at approximately right angles, develops a trellis
                  pattern.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b> Centripetal Drainage Pattern: </b> When the rivers
                  discharge their waters from all directions in a lake or
                  depression, the pattern is know as ‘centripetal’.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Rectangular drainage pattern:</b> Rectangular drainage
                  develops on rocks that are of approximately uniform resistance
                  to erosion, but which have two directions of jointing at
                  approximately right angles or 90 degrees.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b> Radial Drainage Pattern: </b> When the rivers originate
                  from a hill and flow in all directions, the drainage pattern
                  is known as ‘radial’. The rivers originating from the
                  Amarkantak range present a good example of it.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Drainage Systems in India</h3>
              <p>
                On the basis of the mode of origin, nature and characteristics,
                the Indian drainage may be classified into:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Himalayan drainage or Himalayan River Systems;</li>
                <li>Peninsular drainage or Peninsular River Systems.</li>

                The major Himalayan rivers are the Indus, the Ganga and the
                Brahmaputra. These rivers are long, and are joined by many large
                and important tributaries. A river alongwith its tributaries is

                  With a total length of 2,880 km (in India 1,114 km), the Indus
                  is one of the longest rivers of the world. A little over a
                  third of the Indus basin is located in India and the rest is
                  in Pakistan.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It rises in Tibet, near Lake Mansarowar at an altitude of
                  4,164 m in the Kailash Mountain range. The Indus then flows
                  northwest through Ladakh, India, wher it forms the first major
                  tributary, the Zanskar River. Other important tributaries of
                  Indus in Ladakh include Nubra, the Shyok etc. It then flows
                  into Gilgit, just south of the Karakoram range.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Kabul River joins it near Attock. The remainder of its
                  route to the sea is in the plains of the Punjab and Sindh,
                  where the flow of the river becomes slow and highly braided.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It joins the Panjnad, a river formed by the confluence of the
                  Satluj, the Beas, the Ravi, the Chenab and the Jhelum, near
                  Mithankot in Pakistan. Beyond this, the Indus flows southwards
                  eventually reaching the Arabian Sea, east of Karachi.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <div class="note">
                According to the regulations of the
                <b>Indus Water Treaty (1960)</b>, India can use only 20 per cent
                of the total water carried by the Indus river system. This water
                is used for irrigation in Punjab, Haryana and the southern and
                the western parts of Rajasthan.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  River Ganga has a length of 2,525 km. It is shared by
                  Uttarakhand (110 km), Uttar Pradesh (1,450 km), Bihar (445 km)
                  and West Bengal (520 km).
                </li>
                <li>
                  It rises in the Gangotri glacier at Gaumukh ( at an elevation
                  of 4,356 m) in the Uttarkashi district of Uttarakhand. Here,
                  it is known as the Bhagirathi. At Devprayag, the Bhagirathi
                  meets the Alaknanda; hereafter, it is known as the Ganga.
                </li>
                <li>
                  After flowing for 250 km through its narrow Himalayan valley,
                  the Ganges emerges from the mountains at Rishikesh onto the
                  Gangetic Plain at the pilgrimage town of Haridwar.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Ganga is joined by many tributaries from the Himalayas, a
                  few of them being major rivers, such as the Yamuna, the
                  Ghaghara, the Gandak and the Kosi.

                    River Yamuna rises from the Yamunotri Glacier in the
                    Himalayas. It flows parallel to the Ganga and as a right
                    bank tributary meets the Ganga at Prayag (Allahabad).

                    The Ghaghara, the Gandak and the Kosi rise in the Nepal
                    Himalaya. They are the rivers, which flood parts of the
                    northern plains every year, causing widespread damage to
                    life and property, and also, they enrich the soil for

                  The main tributaries, which come from the peninsular uplands,
                  are the Chambal, the Betwa and the Son. These rise from
                  semi-arid areas, have shorter courses and do not carry much

                  Enlarged with the waters from its right and left bank

                    called Padma. The Padma is joined by the Jamuna River, the
                    largest distributary of the Brahmaputra. Further downstream,
                    it is known as the Meghna. This mighty river, with waters
                    from the Ganga and the Brahmaputra, flows into the Bay of
                    Bengal. The delta formed by these rivers is known as the
                    Sundarban Delta which derives its name from the Sundari
                    tree, which grows well in marshland. It is the home of Royal
                    Bengal tiger.

              <h3>The Brahmaputra River System</h3>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  The Brahmaputra, one of the largest rivers of the world (3,969
                  km), has its origin in the Chemayungdung glacier of the
                  Kailash range near the Mansarovar lake (very close to the
                  sources of the Indus and the Satluj). From here, it traverses
                  eastward longitudinally for a distance of nearly 1,200 km in a
                  dry and flat region of southern Tibet, where it is known as
                  the Tsangpo, which means ‘the purifier.’
                </li>
                <li>
                  On reaching the Namcha Barwa (7757 m), it takes a ‘U’ turn and
                  enters India in Arunachal Pradesh through a gorge. Here, it is
                  called the Dihang and it is joined by the Dibang, the Lohit,
                  and many other tributaries; thereafter, it is known as the
                  Brahmaputra. It then enters the state of Assam.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Brahmaputra receives numerous tributaries in its 750 km
                  long journey through the Assam valley. In Bangladesh, the
                  Teesta joins it on its right bank from where the river is
                  known as the Jamuna. It finally merges with the lower Ganga,
                  called the Padma River, which flows into the Bay of Bengal.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Brahmaputra is well-known for floods, channel shifting and
                  bank erosion. This is due to the fact that most of its
                  tributaries are large, and bring large quantity of sediments
                  owing to heavy rainfall.
                </li>

              <h2>The Peninsular Rivers</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                The drainage basins of the peninsular rivers are comparatively
                smaller in size. They are classified based on their direction of
                flow:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Most of the major rivers of the Peninsula, such as the
                  Mahanadi, the Godavari, the Krishna and the Kaveri flow
                  eastwards and drain into the Bay of Bengal. These rivers make
                  deltas at their mouths.
                </li>
                <li>
                  There are numerous small streams flowing west of the Western
                  Ghats. The main west flowing rivers are Sabarmati, Mahi,
                  Bharathpuzha and Periyar. The Narmada and the Tapi are the
                  only long rivers, which flow west and make esturies.

              <h2>Lakes</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                India has many lakes. These differ from each other in size and
                other characteristics. Most lakes are permanent; some contain
                water only during the rainy season, like the lakes in the basins
                of inland drainage of semi-arid regions. There are some lakes
                which are the result of the action of glaciers and ice sheets,
                while others have been formed by wind, river action and human
                activities.
              </p>
              <p>
                Most of the freshwater lakes are in the Himalayan region. They
                are formed when glaciers dug out a basin, which was later filled
                with snowmelt. The Wular lake in Jammu and Kashmir, in contrast,
                is the result of tectonic activity. It is the largest freshwater
                lake in India. The Dal lake, Bhimtal, Nainital, Loktak and
                Barapani are some other important freshwater lakes.
              </p>
              <p>
                Lakes in the region of inland drainage are sometimes seasonal;
                for example, the Sambhar lake in Rajasthan, which is a salt
                water lake. Its water is used for producing salt.
              </p>
              <p>
                Apart from natural lakes, the damming of the rivers for the
                generation of hydel power has also led to the formation of
                lakes, such as Guru Gobind Sagar (Bhakra Nangal Project).
              </p>
              <p>
                Lakes are of great value to human beings. A lake helps to
                regulate the flow of a river. During heavy rains, it prevents
                flooding and during the dry season, it helps to maintain an even
                flow of water. Lakes can also be used for developing hydel
                power. They moderate the climate of the surroundings; maintain
                the aquatic ecosystem, enhance natural beauty, help develop
                tourism and provide recreation.
