              <h1 class="title">Climate of India</h1>
              <p>
                The climate of India is described as the <b>‘monsoon’</b> type.
                In Asia, this type of climate is found mainly in the south and
                the southeast. Despite an overall unity in the general pattern,
                there are perceptible regional variations in climatic conditions
                within the country. Let us take two important elements –
                temperature and precipitation, and examine how they vary from
                place to place and season to season.
              </p>
              <h3>Temperature</h3>
              <ul style="margin: 0">
                <li>
                  While in the summer the mercury occasionally touches 50°C+ in
                  the western Rajasthan, it drops down to as low as minus 45°C
                  in winter around Leh.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Churu in Rajasthan may record a temperature of 50°C or more on
                  a June day while the mercury hardly touches 19°C in Tawang
                  (Arunachal Pradesh) on the same day.
                </li>
                <li>
                  On a December night, temperature in Drass (Ladakh) may drop
                  down to minus 45°C while Thiruvananthapuram or Chennai on the
                  same night records 20°C or 22°C.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                These examples confirm that there are seasonal variations in
                temperature from place to place and from region to region in
                India. Not only this, if we take only a single place and record
                the temperature for just one day, variations are no less
                striking. In Kerala and in the Andaman Islands, the difference
                between day and night temperatures may be hardly seven or eight
                degree Celsius. But in the Thar desert, if the day temperature
                is around 50°C, at night, it may drop down considerably upto
                15°-20°C.
              </p>

              <p>
                In general, coastal areas experience less contrasts in
                temperature conditions. Seasonal contrasts are more in the
                interior of the country.
              </p>
              <h3>Precipitation</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  While snowfall occurs in the Himalayas, it only rains over the
                  rest of the country. Similarly, variations are noticeable not
                  only in the type of precipitation but also in its amount.
                  There is decrease in rainfall generally from east to west in
                  the Northern Plains.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Parts of western coast and northeastern India receive over
                  about 400 cm of rainfall annually. However, it is less than 60
                  cm in western Rajasthan and adjoining parts of Gujarat,
                  Haryana and Punjab. Rainfall is equally low in the interior of
                  the Deccan plateau, and east of the Sahyadris. A third area of
                  low precipitation is around Leh in Ladakh. The rest of the
                  country receives moderate rainfall.
                </li>
                <li>
                  While Cherrapunji and Mawsynram in the Khasi Hills of
                  Meghalaya receive rainfall over 1,080 cm in a year, Jaisalmer
                  in Rajasthan rarely gets more than 9 cm of rainfall during the
                  same period.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Tura situated in the Garo Hills of Meghalaya may receive an
                  amount of rainfall in a single day which is equal to 10 years
                  of rainfall at Jaisalmer.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Ganga delta and the coastal plains of Odisha are hit by
                  strong rain-bearing storms almost every third or fifth day in
                  July and August while the Coromandal coast, a thousand km to
                  the south, goes generally dry during these months.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Most parts of the country get rainfall during June-September,
                  but on the coastal areas of Tamil Nadu, it rains in the
                  beginning of the winter season. In spite of these differences
                  and variations, the climate of India is monsoonal in rhythm
                  and character.

              <h2>Factors Affecting India's Climate</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>

              <p>
                <b>Latitude</b>: The Tropic of Cancer passes through the middle
                of the country from the Rann of Kuchchh in the west to Mizoram
                in the east. Almost half of the country, lying south of the
                Tropic of Cancer, belongs to the tropical area. All the
                remaining area, north of the Tropic, lies in the sub-tropics.
                Therefore, India’s climate has characteristics of tropical as
                well as subtropical climates.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>The Himalayan Mountains:</b> The lofty Himalayas in the north
                provides an invincible shield to protect the subcontinent from
                the cold northern winds. These cold and chilly winds originate
                near the Arctic circle and blow across central and eastern Asia.
                The Himalayas also trap the monsoon winds, forcing them to shed
                their moisture within the subcontinent.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Distribution of Land and Water:</b> India is flanked by the
                Indian Ocean on three sides in the south and girdled by a high
                and continuous mountain-wall in the north. As compared to the
                landmass, water heats up or cools down slowly. This differential
                heating of land and sea creates different air pressure zones in
                different seasons in and around the Indian subcontinent.
                Difference in air pressure causes reversal in the direction of
                monsoon winds.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Altitude</b>: Temperature decreases with height. Due to thin
                air, places in the mountains are cooler than places on the
                plains. For example, Agra and Darjeeling are located on the same
                latitude, but temperature of January in Agra is 16°C whereas it
                is only 4°C in Darjeeling .
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Distance from the sea:</b> Coastal regions experience less
                contrast to changing climate, as they come under the moderating
                influence of nearby seas. As the distance from the sea
                increases, its influence decreases and the people experience
                extreme weather conditions.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Relief:</b> The physiography or relief of India also affects
                the temperature, air pressure, direction and speed of wind and
                the amount and distribution of rainfall. The windward sides of
                Western Ghats and Assam receive high rainfall during
                June-September whereas the southern plateau remains dry due to
                its leeward situation along the Western Ghats.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Pressure and Winds</b>: The climate and associated weather
                conditions in India are governed by the following atmospheric
                conditions:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Distribution of air pressure and winds on the surface of the
                  earth;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Upper air circulation caused by factors controlling global
                  weather and the inflow of different air masses and jet
                  streams;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Inflow of western cyclones generally known as disturbances
                  during the winter season and tropical depressions during the
                  south-west monsoon period into India, creating weather
                  conditions favourable to rainfall;
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h2>The Indian Monsoon</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                The climate of India is strongly influenced by monsoon winds.
                The sailors who came to India in historic times were one of the
                first to have noticed the phenomenon of the monsoon. They
                benefited from the reversal of the wind system as they came by
                sailing ships at the mercy of winds. The Arabs, who had also
                come to India as traders named this <b>seasonal reversal</b> of
                the wind system ‘monsoon’.

                  Indian Ocean Trade and The Monsoons
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Historically, monsoon winds over Indian Ocean played a
                  significant role in aiding trade across the Ocean. So, if you
                  were a sailor, you could count on the wind to bring you from
                  Africa to India if you sailed between June and September, and
                  one that would bring you back to Africa if you sailed between
                  November and February. In fact, these winds were so
                  predictable that early maritime travel guides often listed
                  ideal times of departure down to the week and sometimes even
                  the day. Predictable winds like these, make trade a lot less
                  risky.

              <h3>The Seasons</h3>
              <p>
                The monsoon type of climate is characterised by a distinct
                seasonal pattern. The weather conditions greatly change from one
                season to the other. These changes are particularly noticeable
                in the interior parts of the country. The coastal areas do not
                experience much variation in temperature though there is
                variation in rainfall pattern.
              </p>

              <p>There are four main seasons can be identified in India –</p>
              <ul>
                <li>the cold weather season,</li>
                <li>the hot weather season,</li>
                <li>the advancing/southwest monsoon season and</li>
                <li>the retreating monsoon season.</li>
              </ul>
              <p><b> The Cold Weather Season (Winter) </b></p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The cold weather season begins from mid-November and stays
                  till February in northern India. December and January are the
                  coldest months in the northern part of India. The peninsular
                  region does not have a well-defined cold season. There is
                  hardly any noticeable seasonal change in temperature pattern
                  during winters due to the moderating influence of the sea.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The temperature decreases from south to the north. The average
                  temperature of Chennai, on the eastern coast, is between 24° –
                  25° Celsius, while in the northern plains, it ranges between
                  10°C and 15° Celsius.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Days are warm and nights are cold. Frost is common in the
                  north and the higher slopes of the Himalayas experience
                  snowfall. The weather is normally marked by clear sky, low
                  temperatures and low humidity and feeble, variable winds.
                </li>
                <li>
                  During this season, the northeast trade winds prevail over the
                  country. They blow from land to sea and hence, for most part
                  of the country, it is a dry season. Some amount of rainfall
                  occurs on the Tamil Nadu coast from these winds as, here they
                  blow from sea to land.
                </li>

                <li>
                  A characteristic feature of the cold weather season over the
                  northern plains is the inflow of cyclonic disturbances from
                  the west and the northwest. These low-pressure systems,
                  originate over the Mediterranean Sea and western Asia and move
                  into India, along with the westerly flow. They cause the
                  much-needed winter rains over the plains and snowfall in the
                  mountains. Although the total amount of winter rainfall
                  locally known as ‘mahawat’ is small, they are of immense
                  importance for the cultivation of ‘rabi’ crops.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <b>The Hot Weather Season (Summer) </b>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  With the apparent northward movement of the sun towards the
                  Tropic of Cancer in March, temperatures start rising in north
                  India. From March to May, it is hot weather season in India.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In March, the highest temperature is about 38° Celsius,
                  recorded on the Deccan plateau. In April, temperatures in
                  Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh are around 42° Celsius. In May,
                  temperature of 45° Celsius is common in the northwestern parts
                  of the country. In peninsular India, temperatures remain lower
                  due to the moderating influence of the oceans.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The summer months experience rising temperature and falling
                  air pressure in the northern part of the country. Towards the
                  end of May, an elongated low-pressure area develops in the
                  region extending from the Thar Desert in the northwest to
                  Patna and Chotanagpur plateau in the east and southeast.
                  Circulation of air begins to set in around this trough.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A striking feature of the hot weather season is the ‘loo’.
                  These are strong, gusty, hot, dry winds blowing during the day
                  over the north and northwestern India. Sometimes they even
                  continue until late in the evening. Direct exposure to these
                  winds may even prove to be fatal.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Dust storms are very common during the month of May in
                  northern India. These storms bring temporary relief as they
                  lower the temperature and may bring light rain and cool
                  breeze. This is also the season for localised thunderstorms,
                  associated with violent winds, torrential downpours, often
                  accompanied by hail.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Towards the close of the summer season, pre-monsoon showers
                  are common especially, in Kerala and Karnataka. They help in
                  the early ripening of mangoes, and are often referred to as
                  ‘mango showers’.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <b>Advancing/Southwest monsoon Season (The Rainy Season)</b>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  By early June, the low-pressure condition over the northern
                  plains intensifies. It attracts, the trade winds of the
                  southern hemisphere. These south-east trade winds originate
                  over the warm subtropical areas of the southern oceans. They
                  cross the equator and blow in a south-westerly direction
                  entering the Indian peninsula as the south-west monsoon. As
                  these winds blow over warm oceans, they bring abundant
                  moisture to the subcontinent. These winds are strong and blow
                  at an average velocity of 30 km per hour.
                </li>
                <li>
                  With the exception of the extreme north-west, the monsoon
                  winds cover the country in about a month. The inflow of the
                  south-west monsoon into India brings about a total change in
                  the weather.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Early in the season, the windward side of the Western Ghats
                  receives very heavy rainfall, more than 250 cm. The Deccan
                  Plateau and parts of Madhya Pradesh also receive some amount
                  of rain in spite of lying in the rain shadow area. The maximum
                  rainfall of this season is received in the north-eastern part
                  of the country. Mawsynram in the southern ranges of the Khasi
                  Hills receives the highest average rainfall in the world.
                  Rainfall in the Ganga valley decreases from the east to the
                  west. Rajasthan and parts of Gujarat get scanty rainfall.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Another phenomenon associated with the monsoon is its tendency
                  to have ‘breaks’ in rainfall. Thus, it has wet and dry spells.
                  In other words, the monsoon rains take place only for a few
                  days at a time. They are interspersed with rainless intervals.
                </li>
                <li>
                  These breaks in monsoon are related to the movement of the
                  monsoon trough (low-pressure region). For various reasons, the
                  trough and its axis keep on moving northward or southward,
                  which determines the spatial distribution of rainfall.
                </li>
                <ul style="list-style-type: square; margin: 0">
                  <li>
                    When the axis of the monsoon trough lies over the plains,
                    rainfall is good in these parts.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    On the other hand, whenever the axis shifts closer to the
                    Himalayas, there are longer dry spells in the plains, and
                    widespread rain occur in the mountainous catchment areas of
                    the Himalayan rivers. These heavy rains bring in their wake,
                    devastating floods causing damage to life and property in
                    the plains.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <li>
                  The frequency and intensity of tropical depressions too,
                  determine the amount and duration of monsoon rains. These
                  depressions form at the head of the Bay of Bengal and cross
                  over to the mainland. The depressions follow the axis of the
                  “monsoon trough of low pressure”.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The monsoon rain is known for its uncertainties. The
                  alternation of dry and wet spells vary in intensity, frequency
                  and duration. While it causes heavy floods in one part, it may
                  be responsible for droughts in the other. It is often
                  irregular in its arrival and its retreat. Hence, it sometimes
                  disturbs the farming schedule of millions of farmers all over
                  the country.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p><b>Retreating/Post Monsoons (The Transition Season) </b></p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  During October-November, with the apparent movement of the sun
                  towards the south, the monsoon trough or the low-pressure
                  trough over the northern plains becomes weaker. This is
                  gradually replaced by a high-pressure system. The south-west
                  monsoon winds weaken and start withdrawing gradually.
                </li>
                <li>
                  By the beginning of October, the monsoon withdraws from the
                  Northern Plains. The months of October-November form a period
                  of transition from hot rainy season to dry winter conditions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The retreat of the monsoon is marked by clear skies and rise
                  in temperature. While day temperatures are high, nights are
                  cool and pleasant. The land is still moist. Owing to the
                  conditions of high temperature and humidity, the weather
                  becomes rather oppressive during the day. This is commonly
                  known as ‘October heat’. In the second half of October, the
                  mercury begins to fall rapidly in northern India.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The low-pressure conditions, over north-western India, get
                  transferred to the Bay of Bengal by early November. This shift
                  is associated with the occurrence of cyclonic depressions,
                  which originate over the Andaman Sea. These cyclones generally
                  cross the eastern coasts of India cause heavy and widespread
                  rain. These tropical cyclones are often very destructive. The
                  thickly populated deltas of the Godavari, the Krishna and the
                  Kaveri are frequently struck by cyclones, which cause great
                  damage to life and property. Sometimes, these cyclones arrive
                  at the coasts of Odisha, West Bengal and Bangladesh. The bulk
                  of the rainfall of the Coromandel Coast is derived from
                  depressions and cyclones.
