              <p>
                Secondary activities or manufacturing change raw materials into
                products of more value to people. Paper is manufactured from
                wood, sugar from sugarcane, iron and steel from iron ore and
                aluminium from bauxite.
              </p>
              <p>
                The economic strength of a country is measured by the
                development of manufacturing industries. They provide employment
                to large labour force and contribute significantly in the total
                national wealth/income.
              </p>
              <h2>Classification of Industries</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                On the basis of size, capital investment and labour force
                employed, industries are classified as large, medium, small
                scale, and cottage industries.
              </p>
              <p>On the basis of ownership, industries are categorised as:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Public Sector Industries</b>, that are government/state
                  controlled companies or corporations funded by governments.
                  Industries of strategic and national importance are usually in
                  the public sector.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Private Sector Industries</b> are owned and operated by
                  individuals or a group of individuals.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Joint Sector Industries </b> are owned and operated by the
                  state and individuals or a group of individuals.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Cooperative sector industries</b> are owned and operated by
                  the producers or suppliers of raw materials, workers or both.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                On the basis of raw materials they use, Industries can be
                classified as:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Agro based industries</b> which use plant and animal based
                  products as their raw materials. Food processing, vegetable
                  oil, cotton textile, dairy products and leather industries are
                  examples of agro-based industries.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b> Mineral based industries</b> are primary industries that
                  use mineral ores as their raw materials. The products of these
                  industries feed other industries. Iron made from iron ore is
                  the product of mineral based industry. This is used as raw
                  material for the manufacture of a number of other products,
                  such as heavy machinery, building materials and railway
                  coaches.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Marine based industries</b> use products from the sea and
                  oceans as raw materials. Industries processing sea food or
                  manufacturing fish oil are some examples.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Forest based industries</b> utilise forest produce as raw
                  materials. The industries associated with forests are pulp and
                  paper, pharmaceuticals, furniture and buildings.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>According to their main role, industries are classified as:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Basic or key industries</b> are those which supply their
                  products as raw materials to manufacture other goods e.g. iron
                  and steel and copper smelting, aluminum smelting.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Consumer industries</b> that produce goods for direct use
                  by consumers â€“ sugar, toothpaste, paper, sewing machines, fans
                  etc.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Another common classification of industries is based on the
                nature of the manufactured products. Eight classes of
                industries, thus identified are:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>Metallurgical Industries,</li>
                <li>Mechanical Engineering Industries,</li>
                <li>Chemical and Allied Industries,</li>
                <li>Textile Industries,</li>
                <li>Food Processing Industries,</li>
                <li>Electricity Generation,</li>
                <li>Electronics and</li>
                <li>Communication Industries</li>
              </ol>

              <h2>Industrial Location</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                Industrial locations are complex in nature. These are influenced
                by availability of
                <b
                  >raw material, labour, capital, transport, land power supply
                  and market</b
                >
                , etc. The key to decision of the factory location is the least
                cost. <b>Government policies</b> and
                <b>specialised labour</b> also influence the location of
                industry.

                  alt="  Industrial location Factors"
                  style="width: 100%"
                />
              </div>
              <p>
                It is rarely possible to find all these factors available at one
                place. Consequently, manufacturing activity tends to locate at
                the most appropriate place where all the factors of industrial
                location are either available or can be arranged at lower cost.
              </p>
              <p>
                After an industrial activity starts, urbanisation follows.
                Sometimes, industries are located in or near the cities. Thus,
                industrialisation and urbanisation go hand in hand. Cities
                provide markets and also provide services such as banking,
                insurance, transport, labour, consultants and financial advice,
                etc. to the industry. Many industries tend to come together to
                make use of the advantages offered by the urban centres known as
                <b>agglomeration economies</b>.
              </p>
              <div class="note">
                <b>Foot Loose Industries: </b> Footloose industry is a general
                term for an industry that can be placed and located at any
                location without effect from factors of production such as
                resources, land, labour, and capital. These industries often
                have spatially fixed costs, which means that the costs of the
                products do not change despite where the product is
                assembled.These are generally non-polluting industries.

              <h2>Agro-based Industries</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                Cotton, jute, silk, woollen textiles, sugar and edible oil, etc.
                industries are based on agricultural raw materials.

              <h3>Cotton Textile Industry</h3>
              <p>
                The cotton textile industry is one of the traditional industries
                of India. Fibres are the raw material of textile industry.
                Fibres can be natural or man-made. Natural fibres are obtained
                from wool, silk, cotton, linen and jute. Man made fibres include
                nylon, polyester, acrylic and rayon
              </p>
              <div class="img bigimg">

              </div>
              <p>
                Initially, the British did not encourage the development of the
                indigenous cotton textile industry. They exported raw cotton to
                their mills in Manchester and Liverpool and brought back the
                finished products to be sold in India. This cloth was cheaper
                because it was produced at mass scale in factories in U.K. as
                compared to the cottage based industries of India. Hence,
                traditional cotton textile industry could not face the
                competition from the new textile mills of the West, which
                produced cheap and good quality fabrics through mechanized
                industrial units.
              </p>
              <p>
                The first successful mechanized textile mill was established in
                Mumbai in 1854. The warm, moist climate, a port for importing
                machinery, availability of raw material and skilled labour
                resulted in rapid expansion of the industry in the region. The
                second cotton textile mill was setup in Ahmedabad in 1859. It is
                referred to as the â€˜Manchester of Indiaâ€™.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the second half of the nineteenth century, the cotton textile
                industry expanded very rapidly. The number of units increased
                dramatically. The Swadeshi movement gave a major impetus to the
                industry as there was a call for boycotting all British made
                goods in favour of Indian goods. After Independence, with the
                development of the railway network other cotton textile centres
                expanded rapidly.
              </p>
              <p>
                Coimbatore, Kanpur, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Mumbai, Kolkata,
                Ludhiana, Puducherry and Panipat are some of the other important
                centres. Thus, the cotton textile industry is located in almost
                every state in India, where one or more of the locational
                factors have been favourable. The importance of raw materials
                has given way to market or to a cheaper local labour force or it
                may be the availability of power.

              <h3>Sugar Industry</h3>
              <p>
                The sugar industry is the second most important agro-based
                industry in the country. India stands second as a world producer
                of sugar but occupies the first place in the production of gur
                and khandsari.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sugarcane is a weight-losing crop. The ratio of sugar to
                sugarcane varies between 9 to 12 per cent depending on its
                variety. Its sucrose content begins to dry during haulage after
                it has been harvested from the field. Better recovery of sugar
                is dependent upon its being crushed within 24 hours of its
                harvesting. Sugar factories hence, are located within the cane
                producing regions.
              </p>
              <p>
                In recent years, there is a tendency for the mills to shift and
                concentrate in the southern and western states, especially in
                Maharashtra, This is because the cane produced here has a higher
                sucrose content. Major challenges of this industry include the
                seasonal nature of the industry, old and inefficient methods of
                production, transport delay in reaching cane to factories and
                the need to maximise the use of baggase.

              <h2>Mineral-based Industries</h2>

              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                Industries that use minerals and metals as raw materials are
                called mineral-based industries.
              </p>
              <h3>Iron and Steel Industry</h3>
              <p>
                The iron and steel industry is the basic industry since all the
                other industries â€” heavy, medium and light, depend on it for
                their machinery. Steel is needed to manufacture a variety of
                engineering goods, construction material, defence, medical,
                telephonic, scientific equipment and a variety of consumer
                goods.
              </p>
              <p>
                Production and consumption of steel is often regarded as the
                index of a countryâ€™s development. Iron and steel is a heavy
                industry because all the raw materials as well as finished goods
                are heavy and bulky entailing heavy transportation costs.
              </p>
              <p>
                Iron ore, coking coal and lime stone are the raw materials
                required in the ratio of approximately 4 : 2 : 1. Some
                quantities of manganese, are also required to harden the steel.
                The raw materials are put in the blast furnace where it
                undergoes smelting. It is then refined by removing slag. The
                output obtained is called pig iron. It is further purified by
                melting and oxidising the impurities. Manganese, nickel,
                chromium are added to finally obtain steel which may be used by
                other industries as raw material.

                Chhotanagpur plateau region has the maximum concentration of
                iron and steel industries. It is largely, because of the
                relative advantages this region has for the development of this
                industry. These include, low cost of iron ore, high grade raw
                materials in proximity, cheap labour and vast growth potential
                in the home market.
              </p>
              <p>
                All the important steel producing centres such as Bhilai,
                Durgapur, Burnpur, Jamshedpur, Rourkela, Bokaro are situated in
                a region that spreads over four states â€” West Bengal, Jharkhand,
                Odisha and Chhattisgarh. Bhadravati and Vijay Nagar in
                Karnataka, Vishakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh, Salem in Tamil Nadu
                are other important steel centres utilising local resources
              </p>
              <h3>Aluminium Smelting</h3>
              <p>
                Aluminium smelting is the second most important metallurgical
                industry in India. It is light, resistant to corrosion, a good
                conductor of heat, malleable and becomes strong when it is mixed
                with other metals. It is used to manufacture aircraft, utensils
                and wires. It has gained popularity as a substitute of steel,
                copper, zinc and lead in a number of industries.

                Bauxite, the raw material used in the smelters is a very bulky,
                dark reddish coloured rock. Regular supply of electricity and an
                assured source of raw material at minimum cost are the two prime
                factors for location of the industry.
              </p>
              <p>
                Aluminium smelting plants in the country are located in Odisha,
                West Bengal, Kerala, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra
                and Tamil Nadu.
              </p>
              <h3>Petrochemical Industries</h3>
              <p>
                This group of industries has been growing very fast in India. A
                variety of products come under this category of industries. In
                1960s, demand for organic chemicals increased so fast that it
                became difficult to meet this demand. At that time, petroleum
                refining industry expanded rapidly. Many items are derived from
                crude petroleum, which provide raw materials for many new
                industries, these are collectively known as petrochemical
                industries. This group of industries is divided into four
                sub-groups: (i) polymers, (ii) synthetic fibres, (iii)
                elastomers, and (iv) surfactant intermediate.
              </p>
              <p>
                Mumbai is the hub of the petrochemical industries. Cracker units
                are also located in Auraiya (Uttar Pradesh), Jamnagar,
                Gandhinagar and Hajira (Gujarat), Nagothane, Ratnagiri
                (Maharashtra), Haldia (West Bengal) and Vishakhapatnam (Andhra
                Pradesh).
              </p>
              <h3>Fertiliser Industry</h3>
              <p>
                The fertiliser industry is centred around the production of
                nitrogenous fertilisers (mainly urea), phosphatic fertilisers
                and ammonium phosphate (DAP) and complex fertilisers which have
                a combination of nitrogen (N), phosphate (P), and potash (K).
                The third, i.e. potash is entirely imported as the country does
                not have any reserves of commercially usable potash or potassium
                compounds in any form.
              </p>
              <p>
                After the Green Revolution the industry expanded to several
                other parts of the country. Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh,
                Punjab and Kerala contribute towards half of the fertiliser
                production. Other significant producers are Andhra Pradesh,
                Odisha, Rajasthan, Bihar, Maharashtra, Assam, West Bengal, Goa,
                Delhi, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka.
              </p>
              <h3>Cement Industry</h3>
              <p>
                Cement is essential for construction activity such as building
                houses, factories, bridges, roads, airports, dams and for other
                commercial establishments. This industry requires bulky and
                heavy raw materials like limestone, silica and gypsum. Coal and
                electric power are needed apart from rail transportation.
              </p>
              <p>
                The first cement plant was set up in Chennai in 1904. After
                Independence the industry expanded. Decontrol of price and
                distribution since 1989 and other policy reforms led the cement
                industry to make rapid strides in capacity, process, technology
                and production.
              </p>

                The information technology industry deals in the storage,
                processing and distribution of information. Today, this industry
                has become global. This is due to a series of technological,
                political, and socio-economic events. The main factors guiding
                the location of these industries are resource availability, cost
                and infrastructure. The major hubs of the IT industry are
                Bengaluru, Noida, Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad and Pune.
