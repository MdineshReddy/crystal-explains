              <h3>Location</h3>
              <p>
                India is a vast country. Lying entirely in the Northern and
                Eastern hemispheres. The main land extends between latitudes
                8°4'N and 37°6'N and longitudes 68°7'E and 97°25'E.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Tropic of Cancer (23° 30'N) divides the country into almost
                two equal parts. It passes through 8 Indian states: Gujarat,
                Rajasthan, Madya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, West Bengal,
                Tripura and Mizoram.
              </p>
              <p>
                From the values of latitudes, it is understood that the southern
                part of the country lies within the tropics and the northern
                part lies in the sub-tropical or warm temperate zone. This
                location is responsible for large variations in landforms,
                climate, soil types and natural vegetation in the country.
              </p>
              <p>
                To the southeast and southwest of the mainland, lie the Andaman
                and Nicobar islands and the Lakshadweep islands in Bay of Bengal
                and Arabian Sea respectively.
              </p>
              <p>
                From Gujarat to Arunachal Pradesh, there is a time lag of two
                hours. Hence, time along the Standard Meridian of India
                (82°30'E) passing through Mirzapur (in Uttar Pradesh) is taken
                as the Indian standard time (IST) for the whole country. It is
                5:30 hours ahead of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
              </p>

              <p>
                India is the seventh-largest country in the world, with a total
                area of 3.28 million square kilometres. India’s total area
                accounts for about 2.4 per cent of the total geographical area
                of the world.
              </p>
              <p>
                India measures 3,214 km from north to south and 2,933 km from
                east to west. India has a land boundary of about 15,200 km and
                the total length of the coastline of the mainland, including
                Andaman and Nicobar and Lakshadweep, is 7,516.6 km.
              </p>
              <p>
                India's territorial waters extend into the sea to a distance of
                12 nautical miles (22.2 km; 1 Nautical Mile = 1.852 Km) from the
                coast baseline.
              </p>
              <h3>Neighbours of India</h3>
              <p>
                India has 7 land bordering countries and two maritime bordering
                countries:

                <li>
                  Sri Lanka and Maldives, across the sea in south. Sri Lanka is
                  separated from India by a narrow channel of sea formed by the
                  Palk Strait and the Gulf of Mannar, while Maldives Islands are
                  situated to the south-west of the Lakshadweep Islands.

                The Himalayas together with other ranges, have acted as a
                formidable physical barrier in the past. Except for a few
                mountain passes such as the Khyber, the Bolan, the Shipkila, the
                Nathula, the Bomdila etc. it was difficult to cross it.

                    <b>McMahon Line</b>: Proposed at the Shimla Convention of
                    1914, this line separates Tibet and the north-east India. It
                    was accepted by Tibetan authorities and British India, and
                    is now acknowledged by the Republic of India as the official
                    boundary. But China rejected the Simla Accord and the
                    McMahon Line, contending that Tibet was not a sovereign
                    state and therefore did not have the power to conclude
                    treaties. It forms the northern boundary of Arunachal
                    Pradesh in the eastern Himalayas administered by India but
                    claimed by China. The area was the focus of the 1962
                    Sino-Indian War.

                    and East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) on the eastern side of

                    territory in the Sino-Indian border dispute. It is divided

                    Pradesh and Sikkim, the middle sector in Uttarakhand and

                    former princely state of Jammu and Kashmir. It is a
                    ceasefire line and not an international boundary.
