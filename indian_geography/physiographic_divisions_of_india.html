              <p>
                India is marked by a diversity of physical features. In fact, it
                has practically all major physical features of the earth, i.e.,
                mountains, plains, deserts, plateaus and islands.
              </p>

              <p>
                The physical features of India can be grouped under the
                following physiographic divisions:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>The Himalayan Mountains</li>
                <li>The Northern Plains</li>
                <li>The Peninsular Plateau</li>
                <li>The Indian Desert</li>
                <li>The Coastal Plains</li>
                <li>The Islands</li>
              </ol>

              <h2>The Himalayan Mountains</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                Standing as sentinels in the north are the lofty snow-capped
                Himalayas. These were formed by the ongoing tectonic plates
                collision of the Indian and Eurasian plates
                <a href='/physical_geography/plate_tectonics'>(read more)</a
                >.
              </p>
              <p>
                The approximate length of the Great Himalayan range, also known
                as the central axial range, is 2,500 km from east to west, and
                their width varies between 160-400 km from north to south.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Himalaya consists of three parallel ranges in its
                longitudinal extent. These ranges are Himadri, Himachal and
                Shiwaliks. A number of valleys lie between these ranges.
              </p>

              <h3>Himadri</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The northern-most range is known as the Great or Inner
                  Himalayas or the Himadri.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It is the most continuous range consisting of the loftiest
                  peaks with an average height of 6,000 metres. It contains all
                  prominent Himalayan peaks.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The core of this part of Himalayas is composed of granite.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It is perennially snow bound, and a number of glaciers descend
                  from this range.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <div class="note">
                Mt Everest is the highest Himalayan mountain (8848 m) in the
                World, located in Nepal. K2, the second highest mountain in the
                world (8,611 m) is not located in the Himalayan mountain range
                but located in northwestern Karakoram range. Kangchenjunga is
                the highest himalayan mountain (8598) (3rd highest in the world)
                that is Indian Administered.
              </div>

              <h3>Himachal</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The range lying to the south of the Himadri forms the most
                  rugged mountain system and is known as Himachal or lesser
                  Himalaya.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The altitude varies between 3,700 and 4,500 metres and the
                  average width is of 50 Km.
                </li>
                <li>
                  While the Pir Panjal range forms the longest and the most
                  important range, the Dhaula Dhar and the Mahabharat ranges are
                  also prominent ones.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The ranges are mainly composed of highly compressed and
                  altered rocks.
                </li>
                <li>
                  This range consists of the famous valley of Kashmir, the
                  Kangra and Kullu Valley in Himachal Pradesh. This region is
                  well-known for its hill stations.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Shiwaliks</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The outer-most range of the Himalayas is called the Shiwaliks.
                </li>
                <li>
                  They extend over a width of 10-50 Km and have an altitude
                  varying between 900 and 1100 metres.
                </li>
                <li>
                  These ranges are composed of unconsolidated sediments brought
                  down by rivers from the main Himalayan ranges located farther
                  north.
                </li>
                <li>
                  These valleys are covered with thick gravel and alluvium.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The longitudinal valley lying between lesser Himalaya and the
                  Shiwaliks are known as <b>Duns</b>. Dehra Dun, Kotli Dun and
                  Patli Dun are some of the well-known Duns.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                Besides the longitudinal divisions, the Himalayas have been
                divided on the basis of regions from west to east. These
                divisions have been demarcated by river valleys.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The part of Himalayas lying between Indus and Satluj has been
                  traditionally known as Punjab Himalaya but it is also known
                  regionally as Kashmir and Himachal Himalaya from west to east
                  respectively.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The part of the Himalayas lying between Satluj and Kali rivers
                  is known as Kumaon Himalayas.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Kali and Teesta rivers demarcate the Nepal Himalayas and
                  the part lying between Teesta and Dihang rivers is known as
                  Assam Himalayas.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The Brahmaputra marks the eastern-most boundary of the
                Himalayas. Beyond the Dihang gorge, the Himalayas bend sharply
                to the south and spread along the eastern boundary of India.
                They are known as the <b>Purvachal</b> or the Eastern hills and
                mountains. These hills running through the north-eastern states
                are mostly composed of strong sandstones, which are sedimentary
                rocks. Covered with dense forests, they mostly run as parallel
                ranges and valleys. The Purvachal comprises the Patkai hills,
                the Naga hills, the Manipur hills and the Mizo hills.
              </p>

              <h2>The Northern plains</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                The Northern Indian plains lie to the south of the Himalayas.
                They are generally level and flat. These are formed by the
                <b>alluvial deposits</b> laid down by the rivers– the Indus, the
                Ganga, the Brahmaputra and their tributaries.
              </p>
              <p>
                The plain being about 3,200 km long from the east to the west
                and 150-300 km broad, is a densely populated physiographic
                division. With a rich soil cover combined with adequate water
                supply and favourable climate it is agriculturally a productive
                part of India.
              </p>
              <p>
                From west to east, the Northern Plain is broadly divided from
                into three sections:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The Western part of the Northern Plain is referred to as the
                  Punjab Plains. Formed by the Indus and its tributaries–
                  Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, Beas and Satluj, the larger part of this
                  plain lies in Pakistan. This section of the plain is dominated
                  by the doabs.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Ganga plain extends between Ghaggar and Teesta rivers. It
                  is spread over the states of North India, Haryana, Delhi,
                  U.P., Bihar, partly Jharkhand and West Bengal.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Brahmaputra plain lies to the East of Ganga Plains,
                  particularly in Assam .
                </li>
              </ul>

                From the north to the south, these can be divided into three
                major zones: the Bhabar, the Tarai and the alluvial plains. The
                alluvial plains can be further divided into the Khadar and the
                Bhangar:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Bhabar</b> is a narrow belt ranging between 8-10 km
                  parallel to the Shiwalik foothills at the break-up of the
                  slope. As a result of this, the streams and rivers coming from
                  the mountains deposit heavy materials of rocks and boulders,
                  and at times, disappear in this zone.
                </li>
                <li>
                  South of the Bhabar is the <b>Tarai</b> belt, with an
                  approximate width of 10-20 km where most of the streams and
                  rivers re-emerge without having any properly demarcated
                  channel, thereby, creating marshy and swampy conditions known
                  as the Tarai. This has a luxurious growth of natural
                  vegetation and houses a varied wildlife.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The south of Tarai is a belt consisting of old and new
                  alluvial deposits known as the <b>Bhangar</b> and
                  <b>Khadar</b>
                  respectively.
                </li>
                <ul style="list-style-type: square">
                  <li>
                    The largest part of the northern plain is formed of older
                    alluvium i.e., bhangar. The soil in this region contains
                    calcareous deposits, locally known as kankar.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The newer, younger deposits of the floodplains are called
                    khadar. They are renewed almost every year and so are
                    fertile, thus, ideal for intensive agriculture.

              <h2>The Peninsular Plateau</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                The Peninsular plateau is a tableland composed of the old
                crystalline, igneous and metamorphic rocks. One of the distinct
                features of the Peninsular plateau is the black soil area known
                as <b>Deccan Trap</b>.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Aravali Hills lie on the western and northwestern margins of
                the Peninsular plateau. These are highly eroded hills and are
                found as broken hills. They extend from Gujarat to Delhi in a
                southwest-northeast direction.
              </p>
              <p>This plateau consists of three broad divisions:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>The Deccan Plateau</li>
                <li>The Central Highlands</li>
                <li>The Northeastern Plateau</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Central Highlands</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The part of the Peninsular plateau lying to the north of the
                  Narmada river, covering a major area of the Malwa plateau, is
                  known as the Central Highlands.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The further westward extension gradually merges with the sandy
                  and rocky desert of Rajasthan. The eastward extensions of this
                  plateau are locally known as the Bundelkhand and Baghelkhand.
                  The Chotanagpur plateau marks the further eastward extension,
                  drained by the Damodar river.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The flow of the rivers draining this region, namely the
                  Chambal, the Sind, the Betwa and the Ken is from southwest to
                  northeast, thus indicating the slope.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Deccan Plateau</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The Deccan Plateau is a triangular landmass that lies to the
                  south of the river Narmada. The Deccan Plateau is higher in
                  the west and slopes gently eastwards.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Satpura range flanks its broad base in the north, while
                  the Mahadev, the Kaimur hills and the Maikal range form its
                  eastern extensions.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The Western Ghats and the Eastern Ghats mark the western and the
                eastern edges of the Deccan Plateau respectively.

              <h3>The Northeastern Plateau</h3>
              <p>
                It is an extension of the main Peninsular plateau, visible in
                the northeast, locally known as the Meghalaya, Karbi-Anglong
                Plateau and North Cachar Hills. It is separated by a fault from
                the Chotanagpur Plateau. Three prominent hill ranges from the
                west to the east are the Garo, the Khasi and the Jaintia Hills,
                named after the tribal groups inhabiting this region.

                  To the northwest of the Aravali hills lies the Great Indian
                  desert. It is an undulating sandy plain covered with sand
                  dunes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  This region receives very low rainfall below 150 mm per year.
                  It has arid climate with low vegetation cover.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Streams appear during the rainy season. Soon after they
                  disappear into the sand as they do not have enough water to
                  reach the sea. Luni is the only large river in this region.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Barchans (crescent-shaped dunes) cover larger areas but
                  longitudinal dunes become more prominent near the

              <h2>The Coastal Plains</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>

              <p>
                The Peninsular plateau is flanked by stretch of narrow coastal
                strips, running along the Arabian Sea on the west and the Bay of
                Bengal on the east. The western coast, sandwiched between the
                Western Ghats and the Arabian Sea, is a narrow plain. It
                consists of three sections.
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  The northern part of the coast is called the
                  <b>Konkan</b> (Mumbai – Goa);
                </li>
                <li>
                  The central stretch is called the <b>Kannad Plain</b> and;
                </li>
                <li>
                  The southern stretch is referred to as the

              </ol>
              <p>
                The rivers flowing through this coastal plain do not form any
                delta.
              </p>
              <p>
                The plains along the Bay of Bengal are wide and level. In the
                northern part, it is referred to as the <b>Northern Circar</b>,
                while the southern part is known as the <b>Coromandel Coast</b>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Large rivers, such as the Mahanadi, the Godavari, the Krishna
                and the Kaveri have formed extensive delta on this coast. Lake
                Chilika is an important feature along the eastern coast.
              </p>
              <div class="note">
                The Chilika Lake is the largest salt water lake in India. It

              <h2>The Islands</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                There are two major island groups in India – one in the Bay of
                Bengal and the other in the Arabian Sea.
              </p>
              <h3>Andaman and Nicobar Islands</h3>

              <p>
                The Bay of Bengal island groups consist of about 572
                islands/islets. The entire group of islands is divided into two
                broad categories – The Andaman in the north and the Nicobar in
                the south. They are separated by a waterbody which is called the
                Ten degree channel.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is believed that these islands are an elevated portion of
                submarine mountains. However, some smaller islands are volcanic
                in origin. <b>Barren island</b>, the only active volcano in
                India is situated in the Nicobar islands.
              </p>
              <p>
                The coastal line has some coral deposits, and beautiful beaches.
                There is great diversity of flora and fauna in this group of
                islands. They lie close to equator and experience equatorial
                climate and has thick forest cover.
              </p>
              <h3>Lakshadweep Islands</h3>
              <p>
                The islands of the Arabian sea include Lakshadweep and Minicoy.
                These islands are located at a distance of 280 km-480 km off the
                Malabar coast of Kerala.
              </p>
              <p>
                The entire island group is built of coral deposits. There are
                approximately 36 islands of which 11 are inhabited. Minicoy is
                the largest island with an area of 453 sq. km.
              </p>
              <p>
                The entire group of islands is broadly divided by the Ten degree
                channel, north of which is the Amini Island and to the south of
                the Canannore Island.
              </p>
              <p>
                Kavaratti island is the administrative headquarters of
                Lakshadweep. This island group has great diversity of flora and
                fauna. The Pitti island, which is uninhabited, has a bird
                sanctuary.

                  Coral polyps are short-lived microscopic organisms, which live
                  in colonies. They flourish in shallow, mud-free and warm
                  waters. They secrete calcium carbonate. The coral secretion
                  and their skeletons from coral deposits in the form of reefs:
                  they are mainly of three kinds: barrier reef. fringing reef
                  and atolls. The Great Barrier Reef of Australia is a good
                  example of the first kind of coral reefs. Atolls are circular
                  or horse shoe-shaped coral reefs.

                Every physiographic unit of India complements the other and
                makes the country richer in its natural resources. The mountains
                are the major sources of water and forest wealth. The northern
                plains are the granaries of the country. They provide the base
                for early civilisations. The plateau is a storehouse of
                minerals, which has played a crucial role in the
                industrialisation of the country. The coastal region and island
                groups provide sites for fishing and port activities. Thus, the
                diverse physical features of the land have immense future
                possibilities of development.
