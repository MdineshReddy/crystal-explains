              <h1 class="title">Mineral Resources in India</h1>

              <p>
                Minerals are naturally occurring substances that have a definite
                chemical composition and physical properties. Geologists define
                mineral as a “homogenous, naturally occurring substance with a
                definable internal structure.” Minerals are found in varied
                forms in nature, ranging from the hardest diamond to the softest
                talc.
              </p>
              <h2>Types of Mineral Resources</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                On the basis of chemical and physical properties, minerals may
                be grouped under two main categories of metallics and
                non-metallics which may further be classified as follows:
              </p>
              <div class="img bigimg">
                <img
                  src="../images/geography/types-of-minerals.png"
                  alt="Types of Minerals"
                  style="width: 100%"
                />
              </div>
              <p>
                Metallic minerals are the sources of metals. Iron ore, copper,
                gold produce metal and are included in this category. Metallic
                minerals are further divided into ferrous and non-ferrous
                metallic minerals. Ferrous refers to iron. All those minerals
                which have iron content are ferrous such as iron ore itself and
                those which do not have iron content are non-ferrous such as
                copper, bauxite, etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                Non-metallic minerals are either organic in origin such as
                fossil fuels also known as mineral fuels which are derived from
                the buried animal and plant life such as coal and petroleum.
                Other type of non-metallic minerals are inorganic in origin such
                as mica, limestone and graphite, etc.
              </p>
              <p>Minerals have certain characteristics:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>These are unevenly distributed over space.</li>
                <li>
                  There is inverse relationship in quality and quantity of
                  minerals i.e. good quality minerals are less in quantity as
                  compared to low quality minerals.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The third main characteristic is that all minerals are
                  exhaustible over time. These take long to develop geologically
                  and they cannot be replenished immediately at the time of
                  need. Thus, they have to be conserved and not misused.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h2>Extraction of Minerals</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>Minerals can be extracted by mining, drilling or quarrying.</p>
              <div class="img bigimg">
                <img
                  src="../images/geography/mineral_extraction.png"
                  alt="Types of Mineral Extraction"
                  style="width: 100%"
                />
              </div>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The process of taking out minerals from rocks buried under the
                  earth’s surface is called mining. Minerals that lie at shallow
                  depths are taken out by removing the surface layer; this is
                  known as open-cast mining. Deep bores, called shafts, have to
                  be made to reach mineral deposits that lie at great depths.
                  This is called shaft mining.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Petroleum and natural gas occur far below the earth’s surface.
                  Deep wells are bored to take them out, this is called
                  drilling.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Minerals that lie near the surface are simply dug out, by the
                  process known as quarrying.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <div class="note">
                Most of the minerals in India are nationalised and their
                extraction is possible only after obtaining due permission from
                the government. But in most of the tribal areas of the
                north-east India, minerals are owned by individuals or
                communities. In Meghalaya, there are large deposits of coal,
                iron ore, limestone and dolomite etc. Coal mining in Jowai and
                Cherapunjee is done by family member in the form of a long
                narrow tunnel, known as ‘Rat hole’ mining.
              </div>
              <h2>Mineral Distribution in India</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                India is fortunate to have fairly rich and varied mineral
                resources. However, these are unevenly distributed. Broadly
                speaking, peninsular rocks contain most of the reserves of coal,
                metallic minerals, mica and many other non-metallic minerals.
                Sedimentary rocks on the western and eastern flanks of the
                peninsula, in Gujarat and Assam have most of the petroleum
                deposits. Rajasthan with the rock systems of the peninsula, has
                reserves of many non-ferrous minerals. The vast alluvial plains
                of north India are almost devoid of economic minerals. These
                variations exist largely because of the differences in the
                geological structure, processes and time involved in the
                formation of minerals.
              </p>
              <h3>Ferrous Minerals</h3>
              <p>
                Ferrous minerals account for about three-fourths of the total
                value of the production of metallic minerals. They provide a
                strong base for the development of metallurgical industries.
                India exports substantial quantities of ferrous minerals after
                meeting its internal demands.

                    per cent export unit. Kudremukh deposits are known to be one
                    of the largest in the world. The ore is transported as
                    slurry through a pipeline to a port near Mangaluru.

              <p>
                India’s reserves and production of non- ferrous minerals is not
                very satisfactory. However, these minerals, which include
                copper, bauxite, lead, zinc and gold play a vital role in a
                number of metallurgical, engineering and electrical industries.

                <b> Copper </b>
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  India is critically deficient in the reserve and production of
                  copper. Being malleable, ductile and a good conductor, copper
                  is mainly used in electrical cables, electronics and chemical
                  industries.

                  The Balaghat mines in Madhya Pradesh, Khetri mines in
                  Rajasthan and Singhbhum district of Jharkhand are leading
                  producers of copper.

                <b> Bauxite </b>
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Though, several ores contain aluminium, it is from bauxite, a
                  clay-like substance that alumina and later aluminium is
                  obtained. Bauxite deposits are formed by the decomposition of
                  a wide variety of rocks rich in aluminium silicates. Aluminium
                  is an important metal because it combines the strength of
                  metals such as iron, with extreme lightness and also with good
                  conductivity and great malleability.

                <li>
                  India’s bauxite deposits are mainly found in the Amarkantak
                  plateau, Maikal hills and the plateau region of
                  Bilaspur-Katni. Orissa happens to be the largest producer of
                  Bauxite.

              <h3>Non-Metallic Minerals</h3>
              <p><b>Mica</b></p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Mica is a mineral made up of a series of plates or leaves. It
                  splits easily into thin sheets. These sheets can be so thin
                  that a thousand can be layered into a mica sheet of a few
                  centimeters high.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Mica can be clear, black, green, red yellow or brown. Due to
                  its excellent di-electric strength, low power loss factor,
                  insulating properties and resistance to high voltage, mica is
                  one of the most indispensable minerals used in electric and
                  electronic industries.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Mica deposits are found in the northern edge of the Chota
                  Nagpur plateau. Koderma Gaya – Hazaribagh belt of Jharkhand is
                  the leading producer. In Rajasthan, the major mica producing
                  area is around Ajmer. Nellore mica belt of Andhra Pradesh is
                  also an important producer in the country.

                <b> Limestone </b>
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Limestone is found in association with rocks composed of
                  calcium carbonates or calcium and magnesium carbonates. It is
                  found in sedimentary rocks of most geological formations.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Limestone is the basic raw material for the cement industry
                  and essential for smelting iron ore in the blast furnace.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Major limestone producing states are Karnataka and Andhra
                  Pradesh.

              <h2>Conservation of Minerals</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                The total volume of workable mineral deposits is an
                insignificant fraction i.e. one per cent of the earth’s crust.
                We are rapidly consuming mineral resources that required
                millions of years to be created and concentrated. The geological
                processes of mineral formation are so slow that the rates of
                replenishment are infinitely small in comparison to the present
                rates of consumption. Mineral resources are, therefore, finite
                and non-renewable. Rich mineral deposits are our country’s
                extremely valuable but short-lived possessions. Continued
                extraction of ores leads to increasing costs as mineral
                extraction comes from greater depths along with decrease in
                quality.
              </p>
              <p>
                A concerted effort has to be made in order to use our mineral
                resources in a planned and sustainable manner. Improved
                technologies need to be constantly evolved to allow use of low
                grade ores at low costs. Recycling of metals, using scrap metals
                and other substitutes are steps in conserving our mineral
                resources for the future.
