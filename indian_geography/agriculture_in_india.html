              <h1 class="title">Agriculture in India</h1>
              <p>
                Agriculture is a primary activity, which produces most of the
                food that we consume. Besides food grains, it also produces raw
                material for various industries. India is an agriculturally
                important country. Two-thirds of its population is engaged in
                agricultural activities.
              </p>
              <h2>Types of Farming</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <h3>Primitive Subsistence Farming</h3>
              <p>
                Primitive subsistence agriculture is practised on small patches
                of land with the help of primitive tools. This type of farming
                depends upon monsoon, natural fertility of the soil and
                suitability of other environmental conditions to the crops
                grown.
              </p>
              <div class="img">
                <img
                  src="../images/geography/shifting_cultivation.png"
                  alt="Shifting Cultivation"
                  style="width: 100%"
                />
              </div>
              <p>
                It is a 'shifting' or ‘slash and burn’ agriculture, where the
                farmers clear a patch of land and produce cereals and other food
                crops to sustain their family. When the soil fertility
                decreases, the farmers shift and clear a fresh patch of land for
                cultivation. This type of shifting allows Nature to replenish
                the fertility of the soil through natural processes; land
                productivity in this type of agriculture is low as the farmer
                does not use fertilisers or other modern inputs. It is also
                known as jhumming.
              </p>
              <h3>Intensive Subsistence Farming</h3>
              <p>
                This type of farming is practised in areas of high population
                pressure on land. It is labour-intensive farming, where high
                doses of biochemical inputs and irrigation are used for
                obtaining higher production.
              </p>
              <div class="note">
                Though the ‘right of inheritance’ leading to the division of
                land among successive generations has rendered land-holding size
                uneconomical, the farmers continue to take maximum output from
                the limited land in the absence of alternative source of
                livelihood. Thus, there is enormous pressure on agricultural
                land.
              </div>
              <h3>Commercial Farming</h3>
              <p>
                The main characteristic of this type of farming is the use of
                higher doses of modern inputs, e.g. high yielding variety (HYV)
                seeds, chemical fertilisers, insecticides and pesticides in
                order to obtain higher productivity.
              </p>
              <p>
                The degree of commercialisation of agriculture varies from one
                region to another. For example, rice is a commercial crop in
                Haryana and Punjab, but in Odisha, it is a subsistence crop.
              </p>
              <b>Plantation</b>
              <p>
                Plantation is also a type of commercial farming where a single
                crop is grown on a large area, using capital intensive inputs,
                with the help of migrant labourers. All the produce is used as
                raw material in respective industries.
              </p>
              <p>
                In India, tea, coffee, rubber, sugarcane, banana, etc., are
                important plantation crops. Since the production is mainly for
                market, a well-developed network of transport and communication
                connecting the plantation areas, processing industries and
                markets plays an important role in the development of
                plantations.
              </p>
              <h2>Cropping Seasons in India</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                There are three distinct crop seasons in the northern and
                interior parts of India, namely kharif, rabi and zaid.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The kharif season largely coincides with Southwest Monsoon
                  under which the cultivation of tropical crops such as paddy,
                  maize, jowar, bajra, tur (arhar), moong, urad, cotton, jute,
                  groundnut and soyabean.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Rabi crops are sown in winter from October to December and
                  harvested in summer from April to June. The low temperature
                  conditions during this season facilitate the cultivation of
                  temperate and subtropical crops such as wheat, barley, peas,
                  gram and mustard.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Zaid is a short duration summer cropping season beginning
                  after harvesting of rabi crops. The cultivation of
                  watermelons, muskmelon, cucumbers, vegetables and fodder crops
                  during this season is done on irrigated lands.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                However, this type of distinction in the cropping season does
                not exist in southern parts of the country. Here, the
                temperature is high enough to grow tropical crops during any
                period in the year provided the soil moisture is available.
                Therefore, in this region same crops can be grown thrice in an
                agricultural year provided there is sufficient soil moisture.
              </p>

                Cotton, jute, hemp and natural silk are the four major fibre
                crops grown in India. The first three are derived from the crops
                grown in the soil, the latter is obtained from cocoons of the
                silkworms fed on green leaves specially mulberry. Rearing of
                silk worms for the production of silk fibre is known as

                  It requires high temperature, light rainfall or irrigation,
                  210 frost-free days and bright sun-shine for its growth. It is
                  a kharif crop and requires 6 to 8 months to mature.

                  known as the golden fibre, Jute grows well on well-drained
                  fertile soils in the flood plains where soils are renewed
                  every year. High temperature is required during the time of

                  It is used in making gunny bags, mats, ropes, yarn, carpets
                  and other artefacts. Due to its high cost, it is losing market
                  to synthetic fibres and packing materials, particularly the
