              <h1 class="title">Natural Vegetation of India</h1>
              <p>
                Natural vegetation refers to a plant community that has been
                left undisturbed over a long time, so as to allow its individual
                species to adjust themselves to climate and soil conditions as
                fully as possible. Thus, cultivated crops and fruits, orchards
                form part of vegetation but not natural vegetation.
              </p>
              <p>
                The vegetation, which purely belong to a particular country are
                known as <b>endemic or indigenous</b> species of that country.
                But those which have come from outside countries are termed as
                <b>exotic/alien plants</b>.
              </p>
              <p>
                India is a land of great variety of natural vegetation.
                Himalayan heights are marked with temperate vegetation; the
                Western Ghats and the Andaman Nicobar Islands have tropical rain
                forests, the deltaic regions have tropical forests and
                mangroves; the desert and semi desert areas of Rajasthan are
                known for cactii, a wide variety of bushes and thorny
                vegetation. Depending upon the variations in the climate and the
                soil, the vegetation of India changes from one region to
                another.
              </p>

              <h2>Types of Forests</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                On the basis of certain common features such as predominant
                vegetation type and climatic regions, Indian forests can be
                divided into the following groups:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Tropical Evergreen Forests</li>
                <li>Tropical Deciduous Forests</li>
                <li>Tropical Thorn Forests and Scrubs</li>
                <li>Montane Forests</li>
                <li>Mangrove Forests</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Tropical Evergreen Forests</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  These forests are restricted to heavy rainfall areas of the
                  Western Ghats and the island groups of Lakshadweep, Andaman
                  and Nicobar, upper parts of Assam and Tamil Nadu coast.
                </li>
                <li>
                  They are at their best in areas having more than 200 cm of
                  rainfall with a short dry season. They are also known as
                  Tropical Rainforest.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The trees reach great heights up to 60 metres or even above.
                  Since the region is warm and wet throughout the year, it has a
                  luxuriant vegetation of all kinds â€” trees, shrubs and creepers
                  giving it a multilayered structure. There is no definite time
                  for trees to shed their leaves. As such, these forests appear
                  green all the year round.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Some of the commercially important trees of this forest are
                  ebony, mahogany, rosewood, rubber and cinchona.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The common animals found in these forests are elephant,
                  monkey, lemur and deer. One-horned rhinoceroses are found in
                  the jungles of Assam and West Bengal. Besides these animals,
                  plenty of birds, bats, sloth, scorpions and snails are also
                  found in these jungles.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Tropical Deciduous Forests</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  These are the most widespread forests of India. They are also
                  called the monsoon forests and spread over the region
                  receiving rainfall between 200 cm and 70 cm.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Trees of this forest type shed their leaves for about six to
                  eight weeks in dry summer.
                </li>
                <li>
                  On the basis of the availability of water, these forests are
                  further divided into moist and dry deciduous.
                </li>
                <ul style="list-style-type: square; margin: 0">
                  <li>
                    The tropical moist deciduous forests are found in areas
                    receiving rainfall between 200 and 100 cm. These forests
                    exist, therefore, mostly in the eastern part of the country
                    â€” northeastern states, along the foothills of the Himalayas,
                    Jharkhand, West Odisha and Chhattisgarh, and on the eastern
                    slopes of the Western Ghats. Teak is the most dominant
                    species of this forest. Bamboos, sal, shisham, sandalwood,
                    khair, kusum, arjun and mulberry are other commercially
                    important species.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The dry deciduous forests are found in areas having rainfall
                    between 100 cm and 70 cm. These forests are found in the
                    rainier parts of the Peninsular plateau and the plains of
                    Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. There are open stretches, in which
                    teak, sal, peepal and neem grow. A large part of this region
                    has been cleared for cultivation and some parts are used for
                    grazing.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <li>
                  In these forests, the common animals found are lion, tiger,
                  pig, deer and elephant. A huge variety of birds, lizards,
                  snakes and tortoises are also found here.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Tropical Thorn Forests and Scrubs</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Tropical thorn forests and Scrubs occur in the areas which
                  receive rainfall less than 70 cm. It includes semi-arid areas
                  of south west Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya
                  Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Trees are scattered and have long roots penetrating deep into
                  the soil in order to get moisture. The stems are succulent to
                  conserve water. Leaves are mostly thick and small to minimise
                  evaporation.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In these forests Acacias, palms, euphorbias and cacti are the
                  main plant species and the common animals are rats, mice,
                  rabbits, fox, lion, wild ass, horses and camels.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Montane Forests</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  In mountainous areas, the decrease in temperature with
                  increasing altitude leads to the corresponding change in
                  natural vegetation. These forests cover mostly the southern
                  slopes of the Himalayas, places having high altitude in
                  southern and north-east India.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Himalayan ranges show a succession of vegetation from the
                  tropical to the tundra, with change in the altitude.
                </li>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <b>Deciduous forests</b> are found in the foothills of the
                    Himalayas. It is succeeded by the <b>wet temperate</b> type
                    of forests between an altitude of 1,000-2,000 m which is
                    dominated by evergreen broad-leaf trees, such as oaks and
                    chestnuts.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Between 1,500-1,750 m, pine forests are also well-developed
                    in this zone, with Chir Pine as a very useful commercial
                    tree. Deodar, a highly valued endemic species grows mainly
                    in the western part of the Himalayan range. Deodar is a
                    durable wood mainly used in construction activity.
                    Similarly, the chinar and the walnut, which sustain the
                    famous Kashmir handicrafts, belong to this zone.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Blue pine and spruce appear at altitudes of 2,225-3,048 m.
                    At many places in this zone, <b>temperate grasslands</b> are
                    also found.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    At high altitudes, generally, more than 3,600 metres above
                    the sea level, temperate forests and grasslands give way to
                    the <b>Alpine vegetation</b>. Silver firs, junipers, pines,
                    birch and rhododendrons, etc. occur between 3,000-4,000 m.
                    However, they get progressively stunted as they approach the
                    snow-line. Ultimately, through shrubs and scrubs, they merge
                    into the Alpine grasslands. These are used extensively for
                    grazing by nomadic tribes, like the Gujjars and the
                    Bakarwals.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    At higher altitudes, mosses and lichens form part of

              <h3>Mangrove Forests</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The mangrove tidal forests are found in the areas of coasts
                  influenced by tides. Mud and silt get accumutated on such
                  coasts. Dense mangroves are the common varieties with roots of
                  the plants submerged under water.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The deltas of the Ganga, the Mahanadi, the Krishna, the
                  Godavari and the Kaveri are covered by such vegetation.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In the Ganga-Brahmaputra delta, sundari trees are found, which
                  provide durable hard timber. Palm, coconut, keora, agar, etc.,
                  also grow in some parts of the delta.

                  Royal Bengal Tiger is the famous animal in these forests.
                  Turtles, crocodiles, gharials and snakes are also found in
                  these forests.

              <h2>Forest Conservation</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                The total forest cover in India (2021) is 7,12,249 square
                kilometers which is 21.67% of the total geographical area.
                Forests have an intricate interrelationship with life and
                environment. These provide numerous direct and indirect
                advantages to our economy and society.
              </p>
              <p>
                To a vast number of tribal people, the forest is a home, a
                livelihood, their very existence. It provides them food, fruits
                of all kinds, edible leaves, honey, nourishing roots etc. It
                provides them with material to build their houses and items for
                practising their arts. The importance of forests in tribal
                economy is well-known as they are the source of sustenance and
                livelihood for tribal communities. It is commonly believed that
                the tribal communities live in harmony with nature and protect
                forests.
              </p>
              <p>
                Hence, conservation of forest is of vital importance to the
                survival and prosperity of humankind. Accordingly, the
                Government of India proposed to have a nation-wide forest
                conservation policy, and adopted a forest policy in 1952, which
                was further modified in 1988. According to the new forest
                policy, the Government will emphasise sustainable forest
                management in order to conserve and expand forest reserve on the
                one hand, and to meet the needs of local people on the other.
              </p>
              <p>The forest policy aimed at:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  bringing 33 per cent of the geographical areas under forest
                  cover;
                </li>
                <li>
                  maintaining environmental stability and to restore forests
                  where ecological balance was disturbed;
                </li>
                <li>
                  conserving the natural heritage of the country, its biological
                  diversity and genetic pool;
                </li>
                <li>
                  checks soil erosion, extension of the desert lands and
                  reduction of floods and droughts;
                </li>
                <li>
                  increasing the forest cover through social forestry and
                  afforestation on degraded land;
                </li>
                <li>
                  increasing the productivity of forests to make timber, fuel,
                  fodder and food available to rural population dependant on
                  forests, and encourage the substitution of wood;
                </li>
                <li>
                  creating of a massive peoples movement involving women to
                  encourage planting of trees, stop felling of trees and thus,
                  reduce pressure on the existing forest.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Based on the forest conservation policy the following steps were
                initiated:

              <h3>Social Forestry</h3>
              <p>
                Social forestry means the management and protection of forests
                and afforestation on barren lands with the purpose of helping in
                the environmental, social and rural development. The National
                Commission on Agriculture (1976) has classified social forestry
                into Urban forestry, Rural forestry and Farm Forestry.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Urban forestry pertains to the raising and management of trees
                  on public and privately owned lands in and around urban
                  centres such as green belts, parks, roadside avenues,
                  industrial and commercial green belts, etc.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Rural forestry lays emphasis on promotion of agro-forestry and
                  community-forestry.
                </li>
                <ul style="list-style-type: square; margin: 0">
                  <li>
                    Agro-forestry is the raising of trees and agriculture crops
                    on the same land inclusive of the waste patches. It combines
                    forestry with agriculture, thus, altering the simultaneous
                    production of food, fodder, fuel, timber and fruit.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Community forestry involves the raising of trees on public
                    or community land such as the village pasture and temple
                    land, roadside, canal bank, strips along railway lines, and
                    schools etc. Community forestry programme aims at providing
                    benefits to the community as a whole.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <li>
                  Farm forestry is a term applied to the process under which
                  farmers grow trees for commercial and non-commercial purposes
                  on their farm lands. Forest departments of various states
                  distribute seedlings of trees free of cost to small and medium
                  farmers. Several lands such as the margins of agricultural
                  fields, grasslands and pastures, land around homes and cow
                  sheds may be used for raising trees under non-commercial farm
                  forestry.
