                <h1 class="title">Recession, Depression and Stagflation</h1>
                <h2>Recession and Depression</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>
                  A recession refers to a significant decline in general
                  economic activity in a designated region. It had been
                  typically recognized as
                  <b
                    >two consecutive quarters (or 6 months) of economic
                    decline</b
                  >, as reflected by decrease in Real GDP in conjunction with
                  monthly indicators such as a rise in unemployment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A depression, on the other hand, doesn't have a technical
                  definition, but basically, it's when real GP falls and keeps
                  falling for a long period of time. This has all sorts of
                  terrible effects like high unemployment and falling prices.
                </p>
                <h3>Why are falling prices bad?</h3>
                <p>
                  While we might like the idea of the stuff we buy getting
                  cheaper, falling prices are not really a good thing. But how
                  can cheaper stuff be bad for the economy? Well the goal is to
                  keep prices stable, mainly to avoid rapid inflation, or rising
                  prices,but we also want to avoid excessive deflation which is
                  falling prices.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Too much inflation is bad because it decreases the purchasing
                  power of money; it means you can buy less stuff with the same
                  amount of money, which has all sorts of negative effects on
                  the economy. Business costs increase as workers demand higher
                  wages and interest rates increase, so it's harder to get
                  loans, so people buy less cars and houses.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Deflation on the other hand, seems like it would be a good
                  thing but most economists see falling prices as a bad thing.
                  Falling prices actually discourage people from spending since
                  they might expect prices to fall more in the future. Less
                  spending in the economy means GDP is going to decrease and
                  unemployment's going to increase, and that just becomes a
                  vicious cycle.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So severe recessions are often accompanied by deflation
                  because the demand for goods and services falls, but when the
                  economy starts to improve again, we often see an increase in
                  prices.
                </p>
                <h3>Impact of Recession</h3>
                <p>
                  When economies fall into deep recessions, there are more
                  workers than there are jobs and more output than consumers
                  want to buy. So, both income and prices fall. Central banks
                  can try to use Expansionary Monetary Policy to speed up the
                  economy by lowering interest rates. This encourages consumers
                  and businesses to take out loans, and hopefully, get the
                  economy going again. But if people start changing their
                  expectations and anticipate further price declines, they'll
                  change their behavior in ways that work against the central
                  bank.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For example, if you're planning to buy a refrigerator and you
                  expect prices to fall, you're going to wait to get a lower
                  price. But, if everyone follows that same logic, then spending
                  declines and so does the velocity of money. That leads to
                  further price declines and a vicious cycle of falling prices,
                  which leads to expectations of lower prices, which actually
                  leads to lower prices. It also leads to layoffs at the
                  refrigerator factory and so on. This is called a
                  <b>liquidity trap</b> and some economists believe it's a
                  worsening factor in economic downturns including The Great
                  Depression.
                </p>
                <h2>Stagflation</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>
                  Stagflation is when output slows down or stops or stagnates at
                  the same time prices rise. So, stagnant economy plus inflation
                  equals stagflation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The U.S. experienced stagflation starting in the 1970's, after
                  a series of supply shocks including a rise in oil prices. This
                  combination of events meant the economy couldn't produce as
                  much. The Fed tried to address this by boosting the money
                  supply and cutting interest rates, but output couldn't rise
                  much because of low productivity and the oil shortage. So, all
                  that extra money just triggered inflation. It got even worse
                  when people began to adjust their inflation expectations.
                  Businesses started to expect costs to rise even further, so
                  they laid off workers, and that put the economy back into a
                  recession. When the Fed boosted the money supply again, that
                  raised inflation expectations even more. This ended in the
                  early 80's when a new Federal Reserve Chairman took over. His
                  name was Paul Volcker. He actually cut the money supply and
                  raised interest rates dramatically. Output plummeted, and
                  unemployment reached ten percent, but prices stopped rising
                  and so did inflation expectations. The economy gradually
                  recovered, and Paul Volcker got the credit for ending
                  stagflation.
                </p>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                  So, inflation, hyperinflation, recession, depression,
                  stagflation - they're all extreme economic circumstances, but
                  these extremes show us why it's so important to measure and
                  understand the overall economy. In some cases, government
                  action or inaction made things worse. And in other cases, the
                  government helped the economy get back on its feet.
