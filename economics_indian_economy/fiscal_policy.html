              <div class="article">
                <h1 class="title">Fiscal Policy</h1>
                <p>
                  We know that economy goes up and down over time (referred to
                  as
                  <a href='/economics_indian_economy/inflation_bubbles.html#business_cycle'>business cycle</a
                  >.) The maximum sustainable amount that the economy will
                  produce in the long run is represented by a line called
                  <b>economy's potential GDP</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But the business cycle shows that the economy isn't always at
                  its potential, and when actual output is below potential,
                  that's what economists call a <b>recessionary gap</b>. Workers
                  are unemployed and factories are sitting unused.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Sometimes, actual output can briefly rise above potential.
                  Economists call this an <b>inflationary gap</b>. Unemployment
                  is super low and factories are working overtime, but it's not
                  sustainable. Eventually producers will bid up the price of
                  scarce resources, and higher costs will lead to more inflation
                  rather than more output. Obviously real-life fluctuations
                  aren't as predictable as the business cycle might suggest, but
                  every modern industrialized economy has seen times of boom and
                  bust.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Both recessionary and inflationary gaps caused serious
                  problems. High unemployment is bad; not just for the economy
                  but also for the people. High unemployment rates have been
                  linked to higher suicide rates, more domestic violence, and
                  social upheaval. High inflation can be just as bad. Rising
                  costs wiped out savings and have been the root of protests and
                  riots throughout the world.
                </p>
                <b>Isn't there some way to smooth out these fluctuations?</b>
                <p>
                  There might be. Many economists argue that policymakers should
                  intervene in the macro-economy in order to promote full
                  employment and to reduce inflation. One of the ways to do this
                  is called Fiscal Policy.
                </p>
                <h2>Fiscal Policy</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>
                  The idea of Fiscal Policy is really simple. When the economy
                  is going too slow or too fast, then the government can step on
                  the gas or the brake, by changing government spending or
                  taxes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When the economy falls into a deep recessionary gap, the
                  government can increase government spending, cut taxes, or do
                  part of both. That idea is called
                  <b>expansionary fiscal policy</b>. The idea is that government
                  spending creates jobs and increases income for construction
                  workers, teachers, and other laborers. In turn, these workers
                  spend more of their additional income, increasing consumer
                  spending, and boosting the economy. Cutting taxes follows a
                  similar logic. A tax cut will increase disposable income for
                  consumers, that will increase consumer spending, and boost the
                  entire economy.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But in an inflationary gap, the government can cut spending
                  and raise taxes or do some combination of the two. That's
                  called <b> contractionary fiscal policy</b>. The idea is that
                  higher taxes will leave consumers less money to spend, and
                  lower government spending will mean fewer public jobs. All
                  that should reduce consumer spending, cooling off the economy
                  and reducing inflation. We don't see contractionary fiscal
                  policy very often in practice, because politicians rarely want
                  to hit their voters with a slower economy. It's a hard sell
                  and it could cost policymakers their jobs.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So, the big question here is: does fiscal policy actually
                  work? Does stimulating the economy with spending and tax cuts
                  actually make the economy grow? That is the most heated debate
                  in modern economics.

                <h2>The Great Depression and John Maynard Keynes</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>
                  The Great Depression was a severe worldwide economic
                  depression that took place mostly during the 1930s, beginning
                  in the US after a major fall in stock prices. The Great
                  Depression had devastating effects in both rich and poor
                  countries. Personal income, tax revenue, profits and prices
                  dropped, while international trade fell by more than 50%.
                  Unemployment rose as high as 33% in some countries. Cities
                  around the world were hit hard, especially those dependent on
                  heavy industry. Construction was virtually halted in many
                  countries. Farming communities and rural areas suffered as
                  crop prices fell by about 60%.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The early years of the Great Depression, saw little to no
                  stimulus from the government. Economists and Policymakers
                  argued that unemployed workers would eventually accept lower
                  wages since some pay is better than no pay, and resource
                  prices would eventually fall since fewer people were using
                  resources. Lower costs would lead to more production, more
                  jobs, and the economy will be back on track!
                </p>
                <p>
                  Then entered British economist <b>John Maynard Keynes</b>, one
                  of the most influential and controversial economists of the
                  20th century. Keynes basically invented modern economics, and
                  developed theories and models about spending and production.
                  He is the one that suggested using
                  <b>expansionary fiscal policy</b>
                  to speed up the economy. Keynes argued that government
                  spending can make up for a decrease in consumer spending, so
                  even if the economy does self-correct in the long run, there's
                  no reason to wait it out. His justification? "In the long run,
                  we are all dead." Keynes died in 1946, but his theories live
                  on, and so does the debate.
                </p>
                <h3>Analysis of Keynesian policy</h3>
                <p>
                  At first glance Keynesian policy seems like the perfect
                  solution to fixing a sluggish economy if consumer spending
                  falls, the government can spend its debt, what's the harm in
                  that?
                </p>
                <p>
                  Well, the government has to pay for that spending, they can't
                  just raise taxes to cover, because that would decrease
                  consumer spending and defeat the purpose. So, to stimulate the
                  economy, the government needs to <b>deficit spend</b>. They
                  need to spend more money than they collect in tax revenue. To
                  achieve this, the government needs to borrow money, which
                  result in debt.

                  <h3 style="text-align: center">Deficit vs Debt</h3>
                  <p>
                    A budget deficit is when the government spends more than it
                    brings in tax revenue in a given year. Then it has to borrow
                    money to cover that year's shortfall. The debt is an
                    accumulation of budget deficits.

                  People who don't like Keynesian policy don't like it because
                  it causes debt. The more technical argument against deficit
                  spending is it leads to something called <b>crowding out</b>.
                  If the government borrows a lot of money, that increases
                  interest rates, making it harder to borrow money and buy
                  things like factories and tools. This weakens the economy
                  while increasing government debt.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So how can we figure out who's right? We can start by
                  comparing the actual performance of economies that received
                  stimulus to those that didn't. During the global financial
                  crisis of 2009, the US government launched a huge stimulus
                  program in response to the financial crisis. Despite that,
                  employment and GDP both fell. That sounds like a failure, but
                  the majority of economists think the situation would have been
                  far worse without that stimulus, and while the US was
                  implementing stimulus, most European countries were doing the
                  opposite. They were pursuing a policy called <b>austerity</b>:
                  raising taxes and cutting government spending to reduce debt.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Since 2011, when the US and European policies really started
                  to diverge, the US economy has grown at an average rate of
                  2.5% while the Euro-zone GDP actually shrank by 1%. US
                  unemployment fell to 5.5%, while Euro-zone unemployment rose
                  to 12%.
                </p>
                <h3>Multiplier effect</h3>
                <p>
                  Another thing to keep in mind is the stimulus is complicated,
                  and hard to do well. One reason is because of something called
                  the Multiplier Effect. The multiplier effect refers to the
                  proportional amount of increase, or decrease, in final income
                  that results from an injection, or withdrawal, of spending.
                </p>
                <p>Multiplier= Change in Spending/ Change in Income ​ ​</p>
                <p>
                  <b>Example: </b>For example, assume a company makes a Rs
                  100,000 investment of capital to expand its manufacturing
                  facilities in order to produce more and sell more. After a
                  year of production with the new facilities operating at
                  maximum capacity, the company’s income increases by Rs
                  200,000. This means that the multiplier effect was 2 (Rs
                  200,000/Rs 100,000). Simply put, every Rs 1 of investment
                  produced an extra Rs 2 of income.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Multiplier depends on different situations. When the economy
                  is already booming, the multiplier seems to be close to one.
                  If everyone's already working, and the government wants to
                  build a road, then they're going to have to hire workers away
                  from the private sector. Sure, public sector output increases,
                  but private sector output falls, and GDP is unchanged.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But when the economy is in recession with lots of unemployed
                  workers in lots of unused capital, the multipliers around 2.
                  Due to that ripple effect, an increase of Rs 100 or government
                  spending will lead to about Rs 200 of total spending, which
                  puts some people back to work.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Moreover, different policies have different multipliers,
                  spending on welfare and unemployment is the biggest bang for
                  the buck since people with low incomes are likely to spend
                  their additional income. More targeted tax cuts and tax
                  credits have lower multipliers since they tend to benefit
                  those with higher incomes, who often save rather than spend
                  additional income.
                </p>
                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                  So fiscal policy has its advantages and drawbacks, but in the
                  end, maybe it's all about 'confidence'. When people are
                  miserable and unemployed, they want to feel like help is on
                  the way. Doing nothing doesn't create the kind of confidence
                  that we'll get consumers and businesses spending again, and it
                  doesn't get politicians re-elected. So, it looks like
                  Keynesian policies are here to stay
