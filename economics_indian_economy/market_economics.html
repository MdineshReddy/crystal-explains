                <h2>Markets</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>
                  Market is any place where buyers and sellers meet to exchange
                  goods and services. The key to markets is the concept of
                  <b>voluntary exchange</b>. That is, that buyers and sellers
                  willingly decide to make a transaction.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We've talked about the difference between free market
                  economies, where supply and demand determine what gets
                  produced, and centrally planned economies, where government
                  agencies decide what gets produced. Now we're going to expand
                  on that, and discuss why competitive markets have been more
                  successful at providing most of the things people want.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Central planning has some upsides. Everyone who wants a job
                  has a job, and production aims to meet an idealized version of
                  society's collective goals. But the reality of it has been
                  less ideal for consumers in those societies. In the Soviet
                  Union, central planners were focused on producing heavy
                  equipment and military hardware. There were shortages of
                  consumer goods, like soap, sugar and electronics. So,
                  countries like China and Cuba have moved away from large-scale
                  central planning. The problem with central planning is that
                  it's inefficient. When economists talk about efficiency,
                  they're talking about a couple different types of efficiency:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    The first is <b>productive efficiency</b>: the idea that
                    products are being made at their lowest possible cost. This
                    means that there are no wasted resources and that raw
                    materials, workers, and machines are being used to their
                    fullest potential. Central planners in general, aren't that
                    focused on cost. But in the free market an individual
                    business owner has an incentive not to be wasteful because
                    they want to maximize profit. In the words of Milton
                    Friedman; "Nobody spends somebody else's money as carefully
                    as he spends his own."
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The second type of efficiency is called
                    <b>allocative efficiency</b>: This means that the things
                    we're producing are the things that consumers actually want.
                    In other words, our scarce resources are being allocated
                    towards the things we value.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Free market producers of consumer goods collect a lot of data
                  about consumer preferences through stuff like market research.
                  But they can also learn a lot about consumer's wants by
                  looking at prices. Economists call these
                  <b> price signals</b>.
                </p>
                <h2>Price Signals</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>
                  A price signal is information conveyed to consumers and
                  producers, via the price charged for a product or service,
                  which provides a signal to increase or decrease quantity
                  supplied or quantity demanded. For Example: tablet computers
                  weren't really popular until apple introduced the iPad. After
                  that, the market exploded. When Google, Samsung, and Microsoft
                  saw Apple selling millions of iPads at ₹ 50,000 and up, they
                  had an incentive to jump into the market. Price signals not
                  only tell producers what to make, but they also help
                  distribute tablets to the people that value them the most.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Theoretically, in a free market, producers cannot make
                  themselves better off without making consumers better off. If
                  a company makes too many units of a product or just
                  undesirable stuff, they'll have to adapt quickly, or else it
                  will go out of business. Competition between businesses keeps
                  prices and quality up. This is what Adam Smith's invisible
                  hand meant.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It's important to point out that we're not saying that free
                  markets are always good and that government involvement is
                  always bad. Most economists recognize that markets aren't
                  perfect and they often fail to meet society's needs. In these
                  cases, economists encourage the government to either regulate
                  or take direct control of markets to improve social welfare.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So, price signals help us use our resources efficiently, but
                  that doesn't mean that everyone agrees that they are always
                  right or just. Take price gouging for example.
                </p>
                <h3>Price Gouging</h3>
                <p>
                  Price gouging happens when sellers raise prices for essential
                  items like food, water, or gasoline when there's something
                  like an emergency. Some argue that this practice exploits
                  consumers and as an example of the cruelty of markets.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It's clear that businesses can earn a ton of profit in the
                  short run by price gouging, but what happens in the long run?
                  Consumers are likely to remember how they were treated. This
                  is part of the reason some businesses like Walmart has an
                  emergency operation center and an in-house meteorologist to
                  interpret weather patterns. This allows them to have goods
                  like water and batteries and stock when they're needed. Not
                  only is this profitable, it's also a pretty good public
                  relations move. In fact, in some cases, private businesses
                  were quicker to provide disaster relief than government
                  agencies.
                </p>
                <h3>Predatory Pricing</h3>
                <p>
                  A different example of how the price system is perceived as
                  unjust is below-cost pricing. Sometimes called predatory
                  pricing. This is the idea that a business can drive out
                  competitors by charging lower prices even at a short-term
                  loss. Competitors that can't sustain such low prices will be
                  forced out of the market, giving the surviving businesses
                  market share and the ability to raise prices.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Let's talk about Walmart again. Walmart has been the target of
                  numerous predatory pricing lawsuits. Their size allows them to
                  squeeze distributors and sell products at very low prices.
                  Although lots of consumers like these low prices, it's bad for
                  competitors. Especially small stores, who are sometimes pushed
                  out of the market.

                <p>
                  Predatory pricing is difficult and risky. When a business
                  successfully eliminates their competitors by selling products
                  at a loss, they're eventually going to need to increase their
                  prices above the market price to make up for those losses. In
                  the short run, consumers would have to pay more. But
                  eventually, other businesses would be attracted by the higher
                  prices and enter the market. The end result is that there's no
                  guarantee that predatory pricing is worth it in the long run.
                </p>
                <h3>How can customers correct the corporations?</h3>
                <p>
                  There's tons of examples of corporate greed, inequality, and
                  disregard for the environment that make people wonder if
                  markets are evil. There are also some examples of socially
                  conscious companies that make an effort to protect the
                  environment and help the disadvantaged. Capitalism, with its
                  focus on prices rather than fairness is often characterized as
                  the opposite of altruism. But the two can, and do coexist.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Here's the big takeaway: Capitalism, with its system of price
                  signals, is basically crowdfunding. We collectively choose
                  what we want and how we want it made when we spend our money.
                  After all, companies can't force you to buy their stuff, they
                  have to earn your money. If you want to see real changes in
                  the world, don't just complain that corporations are greedy;
                  expect more from them. If you disagree with the way a retailer
                  treats its workers, then don't buy from them. If we as
                  consumers want our purchases to have a positive impact, it's
                  on us to seek out companies that try to improve the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It's also worth remembering that it's a luxury to have these
                  discussions. For many people around the world who live in
                  poverty and have trouble affording the basic necessities of
                  life, paying a higher price, based on conscience isn't an
                  option.

                <h2>Market Failures</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>
                  In 2015, a story made the rounds online about a University of
                  Maryland professor and an extra credit question: "Select
                  whether you want 2 points or 6 points added onto your final
                  paper grade. But there’s a small catch...if more than 10% of
                  the class selects 6 points, then no one gets any points." So,
                  what would you do? The question alludes to one of the biggest
                  problems with free markets:
                  <b
                    >sometimes people have a personal incentive to do something
                    that is against the collective interests of the group</b
                  >. Obviously, everyone wants at least some extra credit, but
                  there is also an incentive to get even more points.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In this situation, the professor reported that too many people
                  chose 6 points and no one got extra credit. Let's say that
                  your local government sent a similar proposition to every
                  household in your city, “Select whether you want to pay ₹200
                  or ₹1000 to fund the local fire department, but there’s a
                  small catch: if more than 50% of citizens choose ₹200 there's
                  not going to be enough money to have a fire department.” This
                  is the <b>free rider problem</b>. Free riders are people who
                  benefit without paying. They are not necessarily evil, but
                  they're responding to incentives -- why pay more, if I can get
                  it for less?
                </p>
                <p>
                  If too many people think like this, then we're all worse off
                  and we're going to end up not getting the things we want like
                  fire protection. So how do most cities get around the problem
                  that some people will benefit even if they don’t pay. The city
                  doesn’t ask for money, they demand money in the form of taxes.
                  The reasoning is that fire protection is so essential that
                  people shouldn’t be allowed to opt out.
                </p>
                <h3>Public Goods</h3>
                <p>
                  So, things that are for our collective wellbeing, like fire
                  protection, schools, and national defense are often funded by
                  the government. When markets alone fail to provide enough of
                  these things, that's called market failures. These are often
                  called public goods, but the technical definition of a public
                  good is anything that has two characteristics: non-exclusion
                  and non-rivalry.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <b>Non-exclusion</b> is the idea that you can't exclude
                    people that don’t pay. For example, it's impossible to limit
                    the benefits of national defense to only people that pay
                    their taxes. People who pay no taxes still get the benefit
                    of protection from bombs, and people who pay a lot of taxes
                    don’t get extra protection.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Non-rivalry</b> is the idea that one person’s consumption
                    of the good doesn’t ruin it for other people. So, public
                    parks are a great example. You can use it today; I can use
                    it tomorrow; it can be shared (Ideally).
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  If a good or service meets these two criteria it's unlikely
                  that private firms will produce it, no matter how essential it
                  is. Street lights and organizations that track and prevent the
                  spread of diseases are pretty important, and if the government
                  doesn’t step in, we probably won’t get them.
                </p>
                <h3 id="tragedy_of_commons">Tragedy of Commons</h3>
                <p>
                  The incentive to do what's best for you, rather than what's
                  best for everyone is the root cause of something economists
                  call the <b>Tragedy of the Commons</b>. This is the idea that
                  common goods that everyone has access to are often misused and
                  exploited. It explains the cause of most of our environmental
                  problems like air pollution, deforestation, the killing of
                  endangered species, and overfishing. In many places in the
                  world, there are more fish being pulled out of rivers, lakes,
                  and oceans than are being born. This is not just bad for the
                  fish; it’s bad for the people doing the fishing. As these
                  resources are depleted, fishermen find themselves without a
                  job.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So why aren’t they conserving? Allowing fish to reproduce and
                  generate more resources in the future? Well, look at the
                  incentives. If a few environmentally conscious fishermen
                  decide to give the fish time to spawn, then some other
                  fisherman will harvest them instead. If you can’t prevent
                  other people from exploiting the resource, then you have an
                  incentive to exploit it yourself and take as much as you can,
                  as quickly as you can. But, with everyone following that
                  logic, the finite resource gets pillaged. The tragedy of the
                  commons explains why fish stocks get depleted, the rainforest
                  gets cut down, and why endangered species get hunted for their
                  hides or horns. There is an entire subfield of economics
                  focused on address and solving these issues, it is called
                  <b>environmental economics</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The problem here is that unregulated markets sometimes don’t
                  produce the outcome that society wants. Remember, sometimes
                  markets misallocate resources because they don't have the
                  right price signals. There is no better example of this than
                  what economists call <b>externalities</b>. Externalities are
                  situations when there's an external costs or external benefits
                  that accrue to other people or society as a whole. When other
                  people are made worse off that's called a negative
                  externality. When other people are made better off that is
                  called a positive externality. Let’s understand this with an
                  example.
                </p>
                <h3>Externalities Example</h3>
                <p>
                  Let’s look at a TV factory that pollutes a river with toxic
                  chemicals. This is definitely a negative externality. The
                  factory has internal costs: it has to pay its workers, buy raw
                  materials, pay for energy; and it uses those costs to
                  determine how many TVs to produce. But there are also external
                  costs associated with polluting the waterways, like dead fish,
                  contaminated drinking water, and people getting sick. Those
                  external costs are paid by people downstream, and they are
                  likely to be ignored by the factory owner. The free market
                  assumes that all the costs associated with producing TVs are
                  accounted for within the price of those TVs, but, in this
                  case, the market is wrong. The end result is a market failure
                  because the factory is producing too many TVs.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As for positive externalities, think about education. More
                  education is great for you. You'll likely generate more
                  income. But there are also external benefits of your
                  education. Everyone is actually better off. With more
                  education you're more likely be a positive and productive
                  member of society. And if you earn a higher income, that means
                  more tax revenue.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In both cases, economists often look to the government to step
                  in and solve the problem. For example, the government could
                  tax the TV factory or subsidize education. In fact,
                  externalities are the justification for almost everything the
                  government does. When politicians, tax cigarettes, fund
                  education, subsidize fuel efficient cars, or regulate
                  financial markets, it's because they are convinced that free
                  markets alone are not adjusting for externalities.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We’ve tried to explain the problem of externalities, now let’s
                  talk about the solutions. When the government tries to fix
                  externalities, they can use <b>regulatory policies</b> or
                  <b>market-based policies</b>.
                </p>
                <h3>Regulatory policies</h3>
                <p>
                  Regulatory policies are simply rules established by government
                  decree like don’t drive too fast, don’t smoke in public places
                  etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It seems like the government probably should regulate some
                  stuff. The question is, “how much should they regulate?”.
                  Let’s go back to the TV factory example. To help solve the
                  pollution externality, the government could ban the use of
                  certain types of chemicals or set a production quota to limit
                  the production of TVs or regulate what can be dumped in the
                  river.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Regulation can also create positive externalities. In some
                  cases, the external benefits are perceived to be so high that
                  the government essentially takes over the market. Consider
                  education. Most countries have compulsory education which
                  requires citizens to be educated up to a specific age and the
                  government pays for schools through taxes. If the government
                  didn’t get involved, all education would be provided by
                  private schools that would charge tuition; there might not be
                  enough affordable schools to educate young people. The
                  government funds education because they think that the
                  external benefits, like literate, well-informed, erudite
                  citizens, are so high it's worth forcing everyone to pay.
                </p>
                <h3>Market-Based policies</h3>
                <p>
                  Another way that governments try to solve externalities is
                  with market-based policies. These are policies designed to
                  manipulate markets, prices, and incentives to correct for
                  market failures. The best examples are taxes and subsidies.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    A tax on the production of TVs or on the chemicals the
                    factory is using will decrease production and limit
                    pollution.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Grants that help subsidize college education will increase
                    the amount of education people buy.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  In general, economists tend to prefer market-based policies.
                  Take cigarettes for example, they generate high external costs
                  on society. There's higher healthcare costs for everyone, due
                  to smoking related illnesses. The government could force
                  cigarettes companies to produce less, or just shut them down
                  entirely, but instead they tax cigarettes. The tax drives up
                  the price, consumers buy fewer cigarettes, and this addresses
                  the negative externality.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Market-based approach has one key advantage over the
                  regulatory approach. Instead of spending money on enforcing
                  regulations, the government is earning tax revenue that can be
                  used for other purposes. In real life, though, governments
                  often use both policies. In India, the government taxes
                  cigarette producers and regulates where people can smoke. It
                  also restricts how tobacco companies can advertise, and
                  supports anti-smoking campaigns designed to convince people to
                  quit smoking.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Market-based approaches to reduce negative externalities are
                  also used to fight climate change. Many economists argue that
                  taxes on carbon-based fuels like coal, oil, and gas are a more
                  effective way to deal with air pollution. One often discussed
                  market-based policy is emissions trading or
                  <b>“cap and trade.”</b>
                  The government issues pollution permits and if your factory
                  doesn’t hold one of those permits, it can’t pollute. But
                  companies can buy or sell those permits. This sets up
                  incentives to go green: if you can produce without pollution,
                  you can make money by selling your permits. But if you operate
                  a polluting plant, you have to pay for those extra permits.
                </p>
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>
                  Remember that extra credit question? What if the world’s
                  largest economies were given a similar proposition: “Select
                  whether you want to decrease your pollution by 5% or 30%, with
                  a small catch; if more than 50% of counties choose only 5%
                  then climate change will make Earth unlivable." That
                  simplifies the issue, but it does illustrate why it's so hard
                  to address climate change. Individual countries might work to
                  reduce carbon dioxide emissions, but they can’t prevent other
                  countries from polluting. It’s the Tragedy of the Commons.

                  In an unregulated global economy, where producers want to make
                  products as cheaply as possible, there's an incentive to
                  ignore international environment to get ahead. Global issues
                  like climate change, human rights abuses, and nuclear
                  proliferation can't be effectively addressed if countries
                  don’t work together. But that requires a lot of trust and a
                  lot of commitment.

                  So, markets aren't perfect. There are many cases when the
                  government should get involved, and there's even some
                  situations when the government should just take control. The
                  question isn’t “which is better: free markets or government?”
                  The question is “how can they work together to make our lives
                  better?”
