                <h2>Poverty</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>
                  Poverty is a state or condition in which a person or community
                  lacks the financial resources and essentials for a minimum
                  standard of living. Poverty means that the income level from
                  employment is so low that basic human needs can't be met.
                  Poverty-stricken people and families might go without proper
                  housing, clean water, healthy food, and medical attention.
                </p>
                <h3>Types of Poverty</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <b>Absolute Poverty</b>: Absolute poverty is a condition
                    characterized by severe deprivation of basic human needs,
                    including food, safe drinking water, sanitation facilities,
                    health, shelter, education and information.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Relative Poverty</b>: Relative poverty is a measure of
                    income inequality. Usually, relative poverty is measured as
                    the percentage of population with income less than some
                    fixed proportion of median income. Also, there are other
                    different income inequality metrics, e.g., the Gini
                    Coefficient.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Situational Poverty</b>: It is temporary in nature and
                    occurs due to some adverse situation like bad crop,
                    earthquakes, floods or some severe health problem.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Generational or Chronic Poverty:</b> This type of poverty
                    is inherited by household. The two to three generation born
                    into poverty and they do not have tools to come out of this
                    situation.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Estimation</h3>
                <p>
                  The conventional approach to measuring poverty is to specify a
                  minimum expenditure (or income) required to purchase a basket
                  of goods and services necessary to satisfy basic human needs.
                  This expenditure is called the <b>poverty line</b>. The basket
                  of goods and services necessary to satisfy basic human needs
                  is the Poverty Line Basket (PLB). Poverty can be measured in
                  terms of the number of people living below this line.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The poverty ratio in India has been measured from a determined
                  poverty line quantified in terms of per capita consumption
                  expenditure over a month. Households with consumption
                  expenditures below the poverty line are said to be “Below the
                  Poverty Line (BPL)” and deemed poor.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The per capita consumption expenditure level which meets the
                  average per capita daily requirement of 2,400 calories in
                  rural areas and 2,100 calories in urban areas, along with a
                  minimum of non-food expenditure, is called poverty line or
                  absolute poverty.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b> World Bank Poverty Line: </b> Presently, the World Bank
                  defines extreme poverty as living on less than $1.90 a day,
                  measured in 2011 purchasing power parity prices.
                </p>
                <h2>Unemployment</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>
                  Unemployment is a situation when a person actively searches
                  for a job and is unable to find work. Unemployment indicates
                  the health of the economy.
                </p>
                <h3>Types of Unemployment</h3>
                <p>
                  <b> Structured Unemployment </b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Workers are out of work because there's no demand for that
                  specific type of labor. It is due to mismatch between
                  available and required skill set in the economy. Generally, it
                  is due to technological innovation when the skill set of a
                  person becomes obsolete. It also includes technological
                  unemployment, where workers are replaced by machines.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b> Seasonal Unemployment </b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  During the peak agricultural seasons (when the crop is ready
                  for harvesting), more people are required for work. Similarly,
                  in the sowing, weeding and transplantation period, more labor
                  is required. Employment therefore increases at this time.
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, once these seasons are over, the agricultural
                  workers, especially those who do not own land or whose land is
                  not sufficient to meet their basic requirement (these are
                  landless laborer and marginal farmers respectively), remain
                  unemployed. This type of unemployment is known as Seasonal
                  Unemployment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b> Disguised Unemployment </b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  If a person does not contribute anything in the production
                  process or in other words, if he can be removed from the work
                  without affecting the productivity adversely, he will be
                  treated as disguisedly unemployed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The marginal productivity of such unemployed person is zero.
                  This occurs when more than the necessary number of people are
                  employed for the specified work. Agriculture sector of
                  underdeveloped/ developing economics possess this type of
                  unemployment at a large scale.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b> Frictional unemployment: </b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Frictional unemployment is the time period between jobs when
                  worker is transitioning from one job to another. It is
                  sometimes called search unemployment and can be voluntary
                  based on the circumstances of the unemployed individual.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b> Cyclical Unemployment </b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  This type of unemployment is due to the recession in the
                  economy. During recession, there is less requirement of man
                  power on account of the decrease in the level of economic
                  activities and thus, causes cyclical unemployment. This type
                  of unemployment is prevalent in the developed countries.
                </p>
