                <p>
                  In 1798, a British economist named Thomas Malthus argued that
                  population growth would outpace food production, so eventually
                  humans would run out of food and starve (You wonder why some
                  people call economics the dismal science).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Well, Malthus was wrong. The world population has grown from
                  one billion in his time to over seven billion today. And it
                  turns out that the famines we have seen are largely man-made
                  disasters that have very little to do with our ability to
                  produce food. But Malthus was writing at the beginning of the
                  Industrial Revolution. He didn't factor in advancements in
                  technology, agriculture production or transportation. So, with
                  the information he had, he was kind of right, but he was still
                  wrong.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Economic theories are constantly being proven, disproven and
                  revised. The problem is, when these theories are wrong,
                  millions of people can be adversely affected. Take Malthus.
                  Some scholars combined his ideas with those of Charles Darwin
                  and concluded that giving assistance to poor people and social
                  programs like welfare are actually immoral. This is called
                  <b>Social Darwinism</b> and it's completely wrong.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Economics is not an exact science. It aims to draw conclusions
                  about human behavior without the benefits of labs or perfect
                  control groups. Economic theories reflect different attitudes
                  about human nature and those are likely to change over time.
                </p>
                <h2>History of Economic Theories</h2>
                <p>
                  The founder of modern economics was a Scottish philosopher
                  named Adam Smith. In 1776, his book
                  <b>The Wealth of Nations</b>, was published. It was an
                  organized discussion about production, markets and economic
                  theory, and it was tremendously influential. Smith introduced
                  the idea that a person following their own self-interest could
                  end up serving the common good. He also advocated free trade.
                  Many countries at the time had heavy tariffs which protected
                  their domestic manufacturers at the expense of trade.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A generation later, British economist David Ricardo expanded
                  on Smith's ideas by introducing the
                  <b>theory of comparative advantage</b>: the idea that two
                  people or countries can both benefit from trade, even if one
                  of them can produce more of everything. When both focus on
                  what they're best at and then trade, everyone benefits.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As the field of economics grew, ideas like private property
                  and free markets became popular. Then along comes The
                  Communist Manifesto in 1848. Rather than examining individual
                  behavior, German philosophers Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels
                  looked at economic classes and argued that history was
                  explained by the conflict between workers and property owners.
                  This process would inevitably lead workers to overthrow their
                  bosses, ushering in a new stateless and classless system,
                  called
                  <b>communism</b>. Marx followed this up with
                  <b>Das Kapital</b>. Political movements spawned by Marxist
                  economics challenged Adam Smith's view that individual
                  self-interest serves the common good. The end result was two
                  main camps: free market capitalism, supporting private
                  property, and communism, advocating collective ownership of
                  the means of production.
                </p>
                <h3>Classical Economics</h3>
                <p>
                  Despite Marx's challenge, market-based economic theory
                  continued to dominate through the end of the 19th century,
                  with contributions from French, British, and American
                  economics. This body of thought is called
                  <b>Classical Economics</b>, and it was embodied in a book
                  called <b>Principles of Economics</b>, published in 1890 by
                  English Economist Alfred Marshall. Marshall organized and
                  defined concepts we still use today, like supply and demand
                  and marginal utility.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But as capitalism was expanding around the world, Marxist
                  movements were too. By the early 20th century, this battle for
                  ideal economic theory, along with political and social unrest
                  in Europe, led to the establishment of the Soviet Union in
                  1922.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As Communism was maturing in the Soviet Union, the Great
                  Depression crushed the market economies of the world's richest
                  countries, it also dealt a devastating blow to Classical
                  Economics. The theories of Smith and Marshall didn't have much
                  to say about how something like this could happen, or how to
                  fix it. The British economist John Maynard Keynes proposed new
                  answers in his 1936 book
                  <b>A General Theory of Money, Interest, and Employment</b>,
                  which basically launched the field of macroeconomics.
                </p>
                <h3>Keynesian Economics</h3>
                <p>
                  Keynes argued that market economies don't self-correct quickly
                  because prices and wages take time to adjust. He claimed that
                  during recessions, it is necessary for the government to get
                  involved by using monetary and fiscal policy to increase
                  output and decrease unemployment. Keynes wasn't supporting
                  Communism, but his views directly challenged classical
                  economists who saw government intervention as universally
                  harmful for the economy. Eventually Keynesian Economics became
                  part of mainstream economic theory.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Keynes's ideas, combined with the ever-present Marxist
                  critique, opened the door to more and more government
                  involvement. Since the Great Depression, many nations have
                  pursued a political and economic ideology called
                  <b>Socialism</b>, although Socialist ideas and policies have
                  been around since the 19th century. In most cases, these
                  economies allow for private properties and markets, but also
                  have government ownership of industry, significant regulation,
                  and big public programs like universal healthcare. In
                  Scandinavian countries like Norway and Sweden, they love these
                  socialist policies.
                </p>
                <p>
                  US has rejected many of these socialist ideas, but the US
                  government, or at least economists that advise politicians,
                  are clearly in favor of Keynesian economic policies when the
                  economy's in trouble.

                <h3>Hayekian economics</h3>
                <p>
                  As Socialism and Keynesian economics expanded, other groups
                  continued to forcefully push for private property and free
                  markets. The most vocal was often the
                  <b>Austrian school of economics</b>. Friedrich Hayek and
                  Ludwig Von mises from Austria, argued that heavy state
                  involvement has never produced the results it promised, and
                  that regulation and government tinkering is actually a
                  problem, not a solution. Rejecting nearly all forms of fiscal
                  and monetary policy, the Austrian school today argues the
                  economy's just too complicated to manipulate.

                <p>
                  This backlash against government intervention was carried
                  forward in the US by Milton Friedman. Like the Austrians,
                  Friedman advocated privatization of many functions that had
                  been assumed by government, famously proposing school vouchers
                  and deregulation of the economy. He also concluded that the
                  depression could be blamed on botched monetary policy rather
                  than some inherent fault of capitalism.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The theories of Friedman and his followers at the University
                  of Chicago came to be called the
                  <b>Chicago School of economics</b>. Friedman's views got a
                  huge boost in the 1970's. At that time, inflation soared while
                  output stagnated (stagflation). A combination that Keynesian
                  economics had trouble reconciling. Some macroeconomists drew
                  on the insights of the Chicago school to claim that these
                  events disprove Keynesian economics.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Building on the ideas of Friedman, another idea of economics
                  gained traction: <b>monetarism</b>. Monetarists focused on
                  price stability and argue the money supply should be increased
                  slowly and predictably to allow for steady growth. At about
                  the same time, another theory called
                  <b>supply-side economics</b>, or sometimes called
                  <b>trickle-down economics</b> entered the mainstream. Supply
                  side economics advocated deregulation and cutting taxes,
                  especially corporate taxes.
                </p>
                <h3>Modern economics</h3>
                <p>
                  Mainstream economics today takes ideas from both classical
                  economics, including monetarism, and Keynesian economics. This
                  unified theory is sometimes called the New
                  <b>Neoclassical Synthesis</b>. Debates about how and when to
                  implement policies continue.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The different reactions to the global recession in 2008 are a
                  good example of this. Some economists suggested using
                  Keynesian policies, namely deficit spending. Other economists
                  suggested the more classical approach of reducing the excess
                  spending to reduce budget deficits, something called
                  <b>austerity</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Economists are still fighting about which of these policies is
                  the right approach and when to use them. We can all agree that
                  Keynes was right about at least one thing, when he said,
                  "Ideas shape the course of history." So where are all these
                  economic theories and ideologies going to take us in the
                  future? Most countries that once supported strict Communism
                  like China and Cuba have moved toward Capitalism. The only
                  country that's really sticking with its North Korea, but
                  they're too isolated to be a real test case for an economics
                  system.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But this doesn't mean that Marxism is dead. Many capitalist
                  countries have adapted socialist looking programs. It appears
                  the world's economies are converging towards the middle. but
                  in the end, it turns out it's just really hard to predict the
                  future, especially when we're talking about something as
                  complex as the world economy. Remember Malthus's belief that
                  we're all going to starve? Well like Malthus, we don't know
                  what kind of changes humanity's going to face in the future.
                  If history has proven anything about economic thought, it's
                  that we should expect surprises that will upset our current
                  economic models, just like Malthus couldn't imagine that we'd
                  all be alive today.
