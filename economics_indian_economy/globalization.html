                <h1 class="title">Globalization</h1>
                <p>
                  Globalization is the process of interaction and integration
                  among people, companies, and governments worldwide.
                  Globalization has accelerated since the 18th century due to
                  advances in transportation and communication technology. This
                  increase in global interactions has caused a growth in
                  international trade and the exchange of ideas, beliefs, and
                  culture.
                </p>
                <p>
                  International trade has created new opportunities for people
                  to sell their products and labor in a global marketplace.
                  There are some significant downsides to globalized trade. But
                  the statistician Hans Rosling made this point: "The one to two
                  billion poorest in the world, who don't have food for the day,
                  suffer from the worst disease: globalization deficiency. The
                  way globalization is occurring could be much better, but the
                  worst thing is not being part of it."
                </p>
                <h2>Competition</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>
                  Globalization is the result of companies trying to outmaneuver
                  their competitors. While you search for the cheapest place to
                  buy shoes, companies search for the cheapest place to make
                  those shoes. They find the cheapest sources of leather, dye,
                  rubber, and of course, labor. The end result is that labor
                  intensive products like shoes are often produced in countries
                  with the lowest wages, and the weakest regulations.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This process creates winners and losers. The winners include
                  corporations and their stockholders, who earn more profit, but
                  also consumers who get products at a cheaper price. The losers
                  are high wage workers who used to make those shoes, their jobs
                  moved overseas.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But what about the low wage foreign workers? Are they winning
                  or losing? Well, a lot of workers are thrown into hazardous
                  working conditions, but it's also true that many workers in
                  developing countries are at least making more money. These
                  jobs pay above average wages. People want these jobs and
                  although the pay would be unacceptable in developed countries,
                  they're often the best alternative.
                </p>
                <h2>Opponents of Globalization</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>
                  Opponents of globalization called outsourcing of jobs
                  "exploitation and oppression", a form of economic colonialism
                  that put profits before people. A few call for protectionist
                  policies like higher tariffs and limitations on outsourcing.
                  But others focus on the foreign workers themselves by
                  demanding they receive higher wages and more protections.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The root of many arguments against globalization is that
                  companies don't have to follow the same rules they do in
                  developed countries. Some developing countries have no minimum
                  wage laws. They don't have regulations that provide safe
                  working conditions, or protect the environment. And although
                  nearly every country banned child labor, those laws are not
                  always enforced.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But in the absence of regulation, it's still possible workers
                  won't be horribly mistreated. First, public awareness is
                  growing, along with pressure from the international community
                  to take steps to protect workers. The second step comes from
                  those who support globalization. The pro-globalization set
                  argued that as developing economies grow there are more
                  opportunities for workers, which leads to more competition for
                  labor, and higher wages.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Perhaps the strongest argument against globalization is its
                  lack of sustainability. Many experts don't think the planet
                  can sustain a growing global economy. Deforestation,
                  pollution, and climate change aren't going to fix themselves.
                  Especially if increases in living standards lead people to
                  demand more consumer goods like cars, and meat, and
                  smartphones.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Globalization has helped millions of people get out of extreme
                  poverty, but the challenge of the future is to lift up the
                  poor while at the same time keeping the planet livable.
                </p>
                <h2>Microcredits</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>
                  One of the best ways to help those in extreme poverty is to
                  enable them to participate in the economy. This applies to
                  developing countries in the global marketplace, but also to
                  individuals at the local level.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A perfect example is microcredit. In 2006 a Bangladeshi
                  professor named Muhammad Yunus won the Nobel Peace Prize for
                  implementing a simple idea. He gave small loans to low-income
                  people in rural areas. The borrowers, who are mostly female,
                  often used the money to fund plans that could raise their
                  income. For example, they started small businesses.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Microcredit was a success and has since spread to developing
                  countries throughout the world. Private lenders, governments,
                  and nonprofit organizations have jumped onboard to loan
                  billions of dollars to the world's most disadvantaged.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By itself, microcredit isn't going to solve the problem of
                  extreme poverty, but it supports the idea that enabling people
                  to participate in the economy can make their lives better.
                  Yunus explains "In my experience, poor people are the world's
                  greatest entrepreneurs. Every day, they must innovate in order
                  to survive. They remain poor because they do not have the
                  opportunities to turn their creativity into sustainable
                  income."
                </p>
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>
                  Microcredit, when it works, allows people to improve their
                  lives by participating in the economy on their own terms. But
                  we can't forget, a lot of people who participate in the global
                  economy aren't doing it on their own terms. Many of the people
                  who emerged from extreme poverty in the last 25 years have
                  jobs, wages, and working conditions that would be unthinkable
                  in the developed world.
