                <p>
                  Using measurements like life expectancy, child mortality, and
                  income per capita, we can show the majority of humans that
                  ever lived had terrible lives (Statistically speaking). It
                  wasn't until the industrial revolution that people saw
                  significant and sustained increase in their standard of
                  living. Populations skyrocketed, but so did life expectancy
                  and food supplies and hospitals and so on.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It was at the beginning of the industrial revolution that Adam
                  Smith, the first modern economist, wrote his book
                  <b
                    >An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of
                    Nations</b
                  >. Smith concluded it was specialization, or what he called
                  the division of labor, that made countries wealthy.
                </p>
                <h2>Specialization or Division of Layer</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>
                  Specialization is a method of production whereby a person or
                  an organization or a country focuses on the production of a
                  limited scope of goods to gain a greater degree of efficiency.
                  Many countries, for example, specialize in producing the goods
                  and services that are native to their part of the world, and
                  they trade them for other goods and services.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As an example of specialization, think of a pizza restaurant
                  where different workers have specific tasks like preparing the
                  ingredients, making the pizza, putting it in the oven, taking
                  it out and putting it in the box. This division of labor makes
                  each worker more productive since they can each focus on the
                  thing they do best, and they don't waste time switching
                  between jobs.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For thousands of years of human history, specialization was
                  pretty minimal. Of course, humans specialized prior to the
                  industrial revolution, it's one of the marks of civilization,
                  but the modern era has taken this to the extreme. Think of how
                  many people from how many different specialized fields it
                  takes to make a smartphone, all of them working in harmony.
                </p>
                <h2>Trade</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>
                  So, specialization makes people more productive, but Adam
                  Smith said that it's trade that makes them better off. Assume
                  that Country A can produce either shoes or t-shirts. If it is
                  way better at making shoes, then it should specialize in
                  making shoes and then trade with some other country that is
                  way better at making t-shirts. With trade, each of those
                  countries can end up with more shoes and shirts than if they
                  tried to make them on their own.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To fully explain this idea of the benefits of trade, we need
                  to look at an economic model. Models are just visuals to help
                  us simplify and explain concepts.
                </p>
                <h3>Production Possibilities Frontier</h3>
                <p>
                  Production possibilities frontier or PPF shows the different
                  combinations of two goods being produced using all resources
                  efficiently.
                </p>
                <b>Example</b>:
                <p>
                  If the United States uses all of its workers and factories to
                  produce airplanes, it can produce 500 per day, but they can't
                  produce any shoes. If they use all their resources to produce
                  shoes, they can produce 1000 tons per day, but they can't
                  produce any planes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Because the United States has limited resources, they can't
                  produce any combination beyond the production possibilities
                  frontier, so it's impossible to produce 500 planes and 1000
                  tons of shoes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  What if American companies mismanage their resources and try
                  to produce planes in shoe factories and shoes in plane
                  factories? Well, they'd be at a point inside the production
                  possibilities frontier, showing an inefficient use of
                  resources.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So, every possible combination inside the curve is
                  inefficient, and on the curve is efficient and outside the
                  curve is impossible.
                </p>
                <div class="img bigimg">
                  <img
                    src="../images/economy/production_posibility_frontier.png"
                    alt="Production Possibilities Frontier"
                    style="width: 100%"
                  />
                </div>
                <p>
                  Now let's compare this PPF to China's. Assume China can
                  produce 100 planes per day or 800 tons of shoes. Since the
                  United States can produce more planes than China, they have an
                  <b>absolute advantage</b> in the production of planes. The US
                  also has an absolute advantage in the production of shoes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Since the US can produce more of both goods, you might think
                  there's no reason to trade, that they should just produce both
                  on their own. Well, no. Remember, specialization and trade
                  make people, and in this case countries, better off
                </p>
                <p>
                  Let's calculate the opportunity cost for the United States to
                  produce one plane. Every single time they produce an
                  additional plane, it costs them two tons of shoes. China on
                  the other hand gives up 8 tons of shoes for each plane they
                  produce, and since they have a lower opportunity cost, they
                  have what's called a <b>comparative advantage</b>. China has a
                  comparative advantage in the production of shoes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If the US specializes in planes, they can import shoes from
                  China at a lower opportunity cost than if they produce shoes
                  themselves. For example, if these two countries make a deal to
                  trade one plane for four tons of shoes, The US would be better
                  off. They would rather get four tons of shoes per plane from
                  China than only get two tons per plane by making shoes on
                  their own. Now, China is also better off. They would rather
                  trade four tons of shoes for a plane than give up 8 tons for
                  producing a plane on their own.

                  Individual and countries should specialize in producing things
                  in which they have a comparative advantage and then trade with
                  other countries that specialize in something else. This trade
                  is mutually beneficial.

                <p>
                  There are all sorts of intolerable issues associated with
                  international trade, like child labor, dangerous working
                  conditions and pollution. But if there's one point on which
                  most economists agree, it's that specialization and trade
                  makes the world better off.

                  No country in recent decades has achieved sustained
                  improvements in living standards without open trade with the
                  rest of the world. Countries like Cuba, Venezuela, Zimbabwe,
                  and Iran that are voluntarily or involuntarily cut off from
                  the world remain less economically developed than they could
                  be.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On the other hand, countries that have opened their doors to
                  trade like Japan and Taiwan, or, more recently, China and
                  India, have seen massive improvements in their standards of
                  living.
