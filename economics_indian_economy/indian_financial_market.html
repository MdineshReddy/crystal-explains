                <p>
                  Business units have to raise short-term and also long-term
                  funds to meet their working and fixed capital requirements
                  from time to time. This necessitates not only the ready
                  availability of such funds but also a transmission mechanism
                  with the help of which the providers of funds (investors/
                  lenders) can interact with the borrowers/ users (business
                  units) and transfer the funds to them as and when required.
                  This aspect is taken care of by the financial markets which
                  provide a place where or a system through which, the transfer
                  of funds by investors/lenders to the business units is
                  adequately facilitated.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Financial market consists of individual investors, financial
                  institutions and other intermediaries who are linked by a
                  formal trading rules and communication network for trading the
                  various financial assets and credit instruments.
                </p>
                <h3>Bill of exchange and promissory note</h3>
                <p>
                  Before reading further, let us have an idea about two of the
                  credit instruments.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Bill of Exchange</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  A bill of exchange is an instrument in writing containing an
                  unconditional order, signed by the maker, directing a certain
                  person to pay a certain sum of money only to the bearer of the
                  instrument.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Example:</b> Suppose Gopal has given a loan of Rs. 50,000
                  to Ram, which Ram has to return. Now, Gopal also has to give
                  some money to Madhu. In this case, Gopal can make a document
                  directing Ram to make payment up to Rs. 50,000 to Madhu on
                  demand or after expiry of a specified period. This document is
                  called a bill of exchange, which can be transferred to some
                  other person’s name by Madhu.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There are 3 parties in volved in the bill of exchange, they
                  are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <b>Drawer/Maker:</b> is the person who issues the instrument
                    in order to receive a payment.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Drawee:</b> is the person who needs to pay the amount to
                    the drawer.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Payee:</b> is the person who receives the payment. In
                    most cases, the drawer and the payee are the same
                    individuals unless it is transferred to third party payee by
                    the drawer.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  <b> Promissory Note </b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  A promissory note is an instrument in writing containing an
                  unconditional undertaking, signed by the maker, to pay a
                  certain sum of money only to or to the order of a certain
                  person or to the bearer of the instrument.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Suppose you take a loan of Rs. 20,000 from your friend Ravi.
                  You can make a document stating that you will pay the money to
                  Ravi or the bearer on demand. Or you can mention in the
                  document that you will pay the amount after three months. This
                  document, once signed by you, duly stamped and handed over to
                  Ravi, becomes a negotiable instrument. Now Ravi can personally
                  present it before you for payment or give this document to
                  some other person to collect money on his behalf. He can
                  endorse it in somebody else’s name who in turn can endorse it
                  further till the final payment is made by you to whosoever
                  presents it before you.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Two parties are involved in the promissory note. They are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <b>Drawer/Maker:</b> is the debtor who promises to pay the
                    amount to lender or creditor.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Payee:</b> is the creditor who is been promised by the
                    borrower or debtor about the pending payment.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Types of Financial Markets</h3>
                <p>
                  A financial market consists of two major segments: (a) Money
                  Market; and (b) Capital Market. While the money market deals
                  in short-term (up to 364 days) credit, the capital market
                  handles the medium term and long-term credit (above 364 days).
                </p>
                <h2>Money Market</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>
                  The money market is a market for <b>short-term funds</b>,
                  which deals in financial assets whose period of maturity is
                  <b>up to one year</b>. It should be noted that money market
                  does not deal in cash or money as such but simply provides a
                  market for credit instruments such as bills of exchange,
                  promissory notes, commercial paper, treasury bills, etc. These
                  financial instruments are close substitute of money. These
                  instruments help the business units, other organizations and
                  the Government to borrow the funds to meet their short-term
                  requirement.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Money market does not imply to any specific market place.
                  Rather it refers to the whole networks of financial
                  institutions dealing in short-term funds, which provides an
                  outlet to lenders and a source of supply for such funds to
                  borrowers. Most of the money market transactions are taken
                  place on telephone, fax or Internet. The Indian money market
                  consists of Reserve Bank of India, Commercial banks,
                  Co-operative banks, and other specialized financial
                  institutions. The Reserve Bank of India is the leader of the
                  money market in India. Some Non-Banking Financial Companies
                  (NBFCs) and financial institutions like LIC, GIC, UTI, etc.
                  also operate in the Indian money market.

                <p>
                  Following are some of the important money market instruments
                  or securities:
                </p>
                <p><b>Call Money</b></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Call money is mainly used by the banks to meet their
                    temporary requirement of cash. Hence it is basically an
                    <b>inter-bank money market</b> where funds are borrowed and
                    lent, generally, for one day—that is why this is also known
                    as overnight borrowing market (also called money at call).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Fund can be borrowed/raised for a maximum period up to
                    <b>14 days</b>
                    (called short notice).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The rate of interest paid on call money loan is known as
                    <b>call rate</b>. Depending upon the availability and demand
                    of fund in this market the real call rate revolves nearby
                    the current repo rate.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The scheduled commercial banks, co-operative banks operate
                    in this market as both the borrowers and lenders while LIC,
                    GIC, Mutual Funds, IDBI and NABARD are allowed to operate as
                    only lenders in this market.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <b>Treasury Bill </b>
                <p>
                  Treasury bills are money market instruments issued by the
                  Government of India as a promissory note with guaranteed
                  repayment at a later date. Funds collected through such tools
                  are typically used to meet short term requirements of the
                  government, hence, to reduce the overall fiscal deficit of a
                  country. TBs are of following types: the 14-day TBs, 91-day
                  TBs, 182-day TBs and the 364-day TBs. In India, State
                  governments cannot issue TBs. Following are the features of
                  TB:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <b>Minimum investment:</b> As per the regulations put
                    forward by the RBI, a minimum of Rs. 25,000 has to be
                    invested by individuals willing to procure a short-term
                    treasury bill. Furthermore, any higher investment has to be
                    made in multiples of Rs. 25,000.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Zero-coupon securities:</b> G-Sec treasury bills don’t
                    yield any interest on total deposits. Instead, investors
                    stand to realize capital gains from such investments, as
                    such securities are sold at a discounted rate in the market.
                    Upon redemption, the entire par value of this bond is paid
                    to investors, thereby allowing them to realize substantial
                    profits on total investment. For example, a 91-day treasury
                    bill with a face value of Rs. 120 can be bought at a
                    discounted price of Rs. 118.40. Upon maturity, individuals
                    are eligible to receive the entire nominal value of Rs. 120,
                    which allows them to realize a profit of Rs. 1.60.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Trading:</b> The RBI, on behalf of the central
                    government, auctions such securities every week in the
                    market, depending upon the total bids placed on major stock
                    exchanges. Investors can choose to procure such government
                    assets through depository participant commercial banks, or
                    other registered primary dealers (PDs), wherein the security
                    transfer follows a T+1 settlement process. That means,
                    transaction is settled after one day of the transaction.

                  <li>
                    Commercial paper (CP) is a popular instrument for financing
                    working capital requirements of companies. The CP is an
                    unsecured instrument issued in the form of promissory note
                    with a fixed maturity of rarely more than 270 days.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    This instrument was introduced in 1990 to enable the
                    corporate borrowers to raise short-term funds.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Commercial papers are transferable by endorsement and
                    delivery. The highly reputed companies (Blue Chip companies)
                    are the major player of commercial paper market. They can be
                    issues in denominations of
                    <b>5 Lakh or multiples thereof</b>.

                  <li>
                    The CP issuing companies need to obtain a specified credit
                    rating from an agency approved by the RBI (such as CRISIL,
                    ICRA, etc.). Aimed to broaden investor participation, in
                    October 2019, the SEBI allowed listing of the Commercial
                    Papers.

                    should be clearly stated on the Certificate.

                  <li>
                    Minimum amount of a CD should be Rs.1 lakh and in multiples

                  <li>
                    The Government of India, in consultation with the RBI,
                    decided to issue a new short-term instrument, known as Cash
                    Management Bills, since August 2009 to meet the temporary
                    cash flow mismatches of the government.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The Cash Management Bills are non-standard and discounted
                    instruments issued for maturities less than 91 days.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The CMBs have the generic character of Treasury Bills
                    (issued at discount to the face value); are tradable and
                    qualify for ready forward facility; investment in it is
                    considered as an eligible investment in government
                    securities by banks for SLR.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    It should be noted here that the existing Treasury Bills
                    serve the same purpose, but as they were put under the WMAs
                    (Ways & Means Advances) provisions by the Government of
                    India in 1997, they did not remain a discretionary route for
                    the government in meeting its short-term requirements of
                    funds at will. CBM does not come under the similar WMAs

                  Capital Market may be defined as a market dealing in medium
                  and long-term funds i.e., for a period of minimum 365 days and
                  above. It is an institutional arrangement for borrowing medium
                  and long-term funds and which provides facilities for
                  marketing and trading of securities.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So, it constitutes all long-term borrowings from banks and
                  financial institutions, borrowings from foreign markets and
                  raising of capital by issuing various securities such as

                  The market where securities are traded known as Securities
                  market. It consists of two different segments namely primary
                  and secondary market. The primary market deals with new or
                  fresh issue of securities and is, therefore, also known as new
                  issue market; whereas the secondary market provides a place
                  for purchase and sale of existing securities and is often
                  termed as stock market or stock exchange.

                <h3>Primary Market</h3>
                <p>
                  The Primary Market consists of arrangements, which facilitate
                  the procurement of long-term funds by companies by making
                  fresh issue of shares and debentures.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Shares are <b>Equity Instruments</b>. They are small
                    divisions of a company’s capital. When a company goes public
                    for the first time and gets listed on the stock exchanges to
                    raise capital from the market, investors buy a share or
                    number of shares in the company. Purchasing the shares gives
                    shareholders entitlement to the ownership of the company. In
                    other words, you become owners of the company in proportion
                    to the percentage of shares you own. Shareholding of 50% or
                    more makes the shareholders the biggest owners of the
                    company whereas other shareholders get an entitlement to the
                    ownership. As shareholders of the company, you are entitled
                    to dividend payouts given in a certain regular fashion. The
                    dividend payouts can come only if the company is recording
                    profits. Otherwise, shareholders can participate in trading
                    in the stock market to get some value out of their
                    investment. Shareholders are part owners of the company.
                    They get voting rights in the company.

                  <li>
                    Debentures are <b>debt instruments</b> that a company issues
                    under its seal. One difference between share and debentures
                    is that debentures become borrowed capital for the company.
                    It is like a loan that a company has taken from the
                    debenture holders which is supposed to pay back with
                    interest in due time even if the company is running in
                    losses. Debenture holders are creditors to the company. The
                    money invested by debenture holders is basically borrowed
                    capital for the company that it has to pay back with regular
                    interest. This makes debenture holders creditors to the
                    company and at a higher status than shareholders. This means
                    that if the company runs into major debts and is going under
                    liquidations, the creditors of the company including banks,
                    debenture holders, and others will be paid off first.
                    Shareholders are given the last priority. However, unlike
                    shareholders, debenture holders do not get voting rights.
                    This is a major feature that can help you distinguish
                    between shares and debentures.

                  Companies make fresh issue of shares and/or debentures at
                  their formation stage and, if necessary, sub sequently for the
                  expansion of business. It is usually done through private
                  placement to friends, relatives and financial institutions or
                  by making public issue (<b>initial public offerings (IPOs)</b
                  >.). In any case, the companies have to follow a
                  well-established legal procedure and involve a number of
                  intermediaries such as underwriters, brokers, etc. who form an
                  integral part of the primary market.

                <h3>Secondary Markets</h3>
                <p>
                  The secondary market known as stock market or stock exchange
                  plays an equally important role in mobilizing long-term funds
                  by providing the necessary liquidity to holdings in shares and
                  debentures. It provides a place where these securities can be
                  encashed with out any difficulty and delay.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is an organized market where shares and debentures are
                  traded regularly with high degree of transparency and
                  security. In fact, an active secondary market facilitates the
                  growth of primary market as the investors in the primary
                  market are assured of a continuous market for liquidity of
                  their holdings.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The major players in the primary market are merchant bankers,
                  mutual funds, financial institutions, and the individual
                  investors; and in the secondary market you have all these and
                  the stockbrokers who are members of the stock exchange who
                  facilitate the trading.

                  The first organized stock exchange in India was started in
                  1875 in Mumbai known as <b> Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE)</b>.
                  It was followed by Ahmedabad Stock Exchange in 1894 and
                  Kolkata Stock Exchange in 1908. The number of stock exchanges
                  in India went up to 7 by 1939 and it increased to 21 by 1945
                  on account of heavy speculation activity during Second World
                  War. A number of unorganized stock exchanges also functioned
                  in the country without any formal set-up and were known as
                  kerb market. The
                  <b> Security Contracts (Regulation) Act</b> was passed in 1956
                  for recognition and regulation of Stock Exchanges in India.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At present we have 23 stock exchanges in the country. Of
                  these, the most prominent stock exchange that came up is
                  <b>National Stock Exchange (NSE)</b> . It is also based in
                  Mumbai and was promoted by the leading financial institutions
                  in India. It was incorporated in 1992 and commenced operations
                  in 1994. This stock exchange has a corporate structure, fully
                  automated screen-based trading and nation-wide coverage.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Another stock exchange that needs special mention is
                  <b> Over the Counter Exchange of India</b> (OTCEI). An
                  over-the-counter (OTC) market is a decentralized
                  market—meaning it does not have physical locations, and
                  trading is conducted electronically—in which market
                  participants trade securities directly between two parties
                  without a broker. It helps entrepreneurs in raising finances
                  for their new projects in a cost-effective manner. An OTC
                  market handles the exchange of publicly traded stocks that are
                  not listed on the mainstream stock exchanges. In general,
                  companies that trade on OTC markets are smaller than those
                  that trade on primary markets, as OTC markets require less
                  regulation and cost less to use
                </p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>
                  So why do we even need this complicated financial system? Why
                  don't households take their savings and lend them out
                  directly? Well, if you want to loan out your life savings to
                  your neighbor so he can launch his smart phone business, go
                  for it! But that's a pretty risky bet, so you're more likely
                  to use a financial system.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Financial markets, with instruments like stocks and bonds,
                  allow borrowers to crowd source the money they need to borrow.
                  They raise their capital from lots of investors and spread the
                  risk around.
                </p>
                <p>
                  From the lender's point of view, a financial system allows you
                  to spread your savings over dozens or hundreds of different
                  loans. A few companies might go bankrupt and a few people
                  might not pay back their car loans, but those losses will be
                  offset by borrowers who do pay back their loans. You don't
                  have to put all your eggs in one basket.

                <h2>Additional Info: Derivatives Market</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>
                  The derivatives market is a financial market that trades
                  security that derives its value from its underlying assets. A
                  derivative is a contract and its value is determined by the
                  market price of the underlying item. The most common
                  underlying assets for derivatives are stocks, bonds,
                  commodities, currencies, interest rates, and market indexes.
                  These assets are commonly purchased through brokerages. This
                  financial market trade derivatives including forward
                  contracts, futures, options, swaps and
                  contracts-for-difference.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b> Futures contracts</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Futures contracts also known simply as futures—are an
                  agreement between two parties for the purchase and delivery of
                  an asset at an agreed upon price at a future date. Futures
                  trade on an exchange, and the contracts are standardized.
                  Traders will use a futures contract to hedge their risk or
                  speculate on the price of an underlying asset. The parties
                  involved in the futures transaction are obligated to fulfill a
                  commitment to buy or sell the underlying asset.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For example, say that July. 6, 2021, Company-A buys a futures
                  contract for oil at a price of $62.22 per barrel that expires
                  Dec. 19, 2021. The company does this because it needs oil in
                  December and is concerned that the price will rise before the
                  company needs to buy. Buying an oil futures contract hedges
                  the company's risk because the seller on the other side of the
                  contract is obligated to deliver oil to Company-A for $62.22
                  per barrel once the contract has expired. Assume oil prices
                  rise to $80 per barrel by Dec. 19, 2021. Company-A can accept
                  delivery of the oil from the seller of the futures contract,
                  but if it no longer needs the oil, it can also sell the
                  contract before expiration and keep the profits.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In this example, it is possible that both the futures buyer
                  and seller were hedging risk. Company-A needed oil in the
                  future and wanted to offset the risk that the price may rise
                  in December with a long position in an oil futures contract.
                  The seller could be an oil company that was concerned about
                  falling oil prices and wanted to eliminate that risk by
                  selling or " shorting" a futures contract that fixed the price
                  it would get in December.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b> Forward contracts </b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Forward contracts known simply as forwards—are similar to
                  futures, but do not trade on an exchange, only
                  over-the-counter. When a forward contract is created, the
                  buyer and seller may have customized the terms, size and
                  settlement process for the derivative. As OTC products,
                  forward contracts carry a greater degree of counterparty risk
                  for both buyers and sellers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Counterparty risks are a kind of credit risk in that the buyer
                  or seller may not be able to live up to the obligations
                  outlined in the contract. If one party of the contract becomes
                  insolvent, the other party may have no recourse and could lose
                  the value of its position.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b> Swaps </b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Swaps are another common type of derivative, often used to
                  exchange one kind of cash flow with another. For example, a
                  trader might use an interest rate swap to switch from a
                  variable interest rate loan to a fixed interest rate loan, or
                  vice versa.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Imagine that Company XYZ has borrowed Rs 1,000,000 and pays a
                  variable rate of interest on the loan that is currently 6%.
                  XYZ may be concerned about rising interest rates that will
                  increase the costs of this loan or encounter a lender that is
                  reluctant to extend more credit while the company has this
                  variable rate risk.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Assume that XYZ creates a swap with Company QRS, which is
                  willing to exchange the payments owed on the variable rate
                  loan for the payments owed on a fixed rate loan of 7%. That
                  means that XYZ will pay 7% to QRS on its $1,000,000 principal,
                  and QRS will pay XYZ 6% interest on the same principal. At the
                  beginning of the swap, XYZ will just pay QRS the 1% difference
                  between the two swap rates.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If interest rates fall so that the variable rate on the
                  original loan is now 5%, Company XYZ will have to pay Company
                  QRS the 2% difference on the loan. If interest rates rise to
                  8%, then QRS would have to pay XYZ the 1% difference between
                  the two swap rates. Regardless of how interest rates change,
                  the swap has achieved XYZ's original objective of turning a
                  variable rate loan into a fixed rate loan
                </p>
                <p>
                  Swaps can also be constructed to exchange currency exchange
                  rate risk or the risk of default on a loan or cash flows from
                  other business activities. Swaps related to the cash flows and
                  potential defaults of mortgage bonds are an extremely popular
                  kind of derivative—a bit too popular. In the past. It was the
                  counterparty risk of swaps like this that eventually spiraled
                  into the credit crisis of 2008.
                </p>
                <div class="note">
                  <b>Credit Default Swap:</b> A credit default swap (CDS) is a
                  financial derivative or contract that allows an investor to
                  "swap" or offset his or her credit risk with that of another
                  investor. For example, if a lender is worried that a borrower
                  is going to default on a loan, the lender could use a CDS to
                  offset or swap that risk. To swap the risk of default, the
                  lender buys a CDS from another investor who agrees to
                  reimburse the lender in the case the borrower defaults. Most
                  CDS will require an ongoing premium payment to maintain the
                  contract, which is like an insurance policy
                </div>
                <p>
                  <b>Options</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  An options contract is similar to a futures contract in that
                  it is an agreement between two parties to buy or sell an asset
                  at a predetermined future date for a specific price. The key
                  difference between options and futures is that, with an
                  option, the buyer is not obliged to exercise their agreement
                  to buy or sell. It is an opportunity only, not an
                  obligation—futures are obligations. As with futures, options
                  may be used to hedge or speculate on the price of the
                  underlying asset.
