                <p>
                  Banks are the most important financial intermediary. In the
                  nineteenth century, banks mainly lent money to firms to help
                  finance their inventories, which were held as collateral. In
                  the cases of defaulters, banks seized them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Gradually, banks expanded their lending activities to finance
                  houses and commercial real estates – holding the buildings as
                  collateral. Emergence of information technology has presented
                  special problems to these traditional forms of finance—if the
                  idea does not pan out, the firm may go bankrupt, but there is
                  no collateral— there is little of value that the creditor can
                  seize.
                </p>
                <h2>Banking History in India</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>
                  The sense in which we today use the term banking has its
                  origin in the western world. It was introduced in India by the
                  British rulers, way back in the 17th century. Since then,
                  several changes have taken place in the sector and today
                  Indian banks are among the finest in the emerging market
                  economics well-directed towards becoming global.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Bank of Hindustan was the first bank in India, established in
                  Calcutta in 1770. It liquidated between 1829–32. Later three
                  Presidency Banks were established by the East India Company:
                  Bank of Bengal(1806), Bank of Bombay (1840) and Bank of Madras
                  (1843). All three of them were merged to form Imperial Bank of
                  India in 1921, which was later nationalized and renamed State
                  Bank of India in 1955.
                </p>
                <h3>Origins of RBI</h3>
                <p>
                  The origins of the Reserve Bank of India can be traced to
                  1926, when the Royal Commission on Indian Currency and Finance
                  – also known as the <b>Hilton-Young Commission</b> –
                  recommended the creation of a central bank for India to
                  separate the control of currency and credit from the
                  Government and to augment banking facilities throughout the
                  country.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Reserve Bank of India Act of 1934 established the Reserve
                  Bank in Calcutta (which was shifted to Bombay in 1937) and
                  set-in motion a series of actions culminating in the start of
                  operations in 1935. Since then, the Reserve Bank’s role and
                  functions have undergone numerous changes, as the nature of
                  the Indian economy and financial sector changed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Starting as a private shareholders’ bank, the Reserve Bank was
                  nationalized in 1949. It then assumed the responsibility to
                  meet the aspirations of a newly independent country and its
                  people.
                </p>
                <h3>First Phase of Bank's Nationalization - 1969</h3>
                <p>
                  Prior to 1969, majority of the Indian banks, except the State
                  Bank of India, were owned by the private individuals. With the
                  objectives of ensuring Social Welfare, credit availability to
                  the needy sectors such as agriculture, small and village
                  industries, checking private monopoly and reducing regional
                  Imbalance, Indira Gandhi Government nationalized the 14
                  largest commercial banks with effect from the midnight of 19
                  July 1969. Banks with deposits over 50 crores were
                  nationalized. These banks contained 85 percent of bank
                  deposits in the country. They are:

                <h3>Origin of Regional Rural Banks</h3>
                <p>
                  The Indian Banking system immensely developed after
                  nationalization, but the rural and weaker section of the
                  society was still not covered under the system. To solve these
                  issues, the Narasimham Committee in 1974 recommended the
                  establishment of Regional Rural Banks (RRB). On 2nd October
                  1975, RRBs were established under an ordinance which was later
                  replaced by Regional Rural Bank Act, 1976. First RRB was
                  Prathama Grameen Bank sponsored by Syndicate Bank established
                  on 2 nd Oct 1975 at Moradabad (UP).

                <h3>Second Phase of nationalization - 1980</h3>
                <p>
                  A second round of nationalization of six more commercial banks
                  with deposits were more than ₹200 crore, followed in 1980. The
                  stated reason for the nationalization was to give the
                  government more control of credit delivery. With the second
                  round of nationalizations, the Government of India controlled
                  around 91% of the banking business of India. The six banks
                  were:

                  *The government merged New Bank of India with Punjab National
                  Bank in 1993. It was the first merger between nationalized
                  banks. Until the 1990s, the nationalized banks grew at a pace
                  of around 4%, closer to the average growth rate of the Indian
                  economy.

                <div class="note">
                  On July 12th, 1982, the National Bank for Agriculture and
                  Rural Development (NABARD) was established for development of
                  rural areas by recommendation of the Shivaraman Committee.

                <h3>1990s - Liberalization</h3>
                <p>
                  In the early 1990s, the then government embarked on a policy
                  of liberalization, licensing a small number of private banks.
                  These came to be known as New Generation tech-savvy banks and
                  included Global Trust Bank (the first of such new generation
                  banks to be set up), which later amalgamated with Oriental
                  Bank of Commerce, IndusInd Bank, UTI Bank (since renamed Axis
                  Bank), ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This move, along with the rapid growth in the economy of
                  India, revitalized the banking sector in India, which has seen
                  rapid growth with strong contribution from all the three
                  sectors of banks, namely, government banks, private banks and
                  foreign banks.

                <h2>Types of Banks in India</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>
                  There are two broad categories under which banks are
                  classified in India- Scheduled and Non-Scheduled Banks.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <b>Scheduled Banks</b> are the banks which are covered under
                    the second schedule of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934.
                    To qualify for being a scheduled bank, a minimum of 5 lakh
                    paid-up capital is required on the bank’s behalf. The RBI
                    lends loan to these banks at bank rate as and when required.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Non-scheduled banks</b> refer to the local area banks
                    which are not listed in the Second Schedule of Reserve Bank
                    of India. Non - Scheduled Banks are also required to
                    maintain the statutory cash reserve requirement, not with
                    the RBI, but with them. Non-Scheduled Banks are also not
                    eligible for having loans from the RBI for day-to-day
                    activities but under the emergency conditions RBI can grant
                    loan to them.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Scheduled Banks</h3>
                <p>
                  The scheduled banks include Commercial Banks and Cooperative
                  Banks.

                  Regulation Act, 1949. These are profit making banks based on
                  their business model. Granting loans to the government,
                  general public, and corporate and accepting deposits counts as
                  the primary function. The commercial banks include Regional
                  Rural Banks, Small Finance Banks, Foreign Banks, Private
                  Sector Banks and Public Sector Banks. Payment Bank is a new

                    Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC)
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    NBFCs (Non-Banking Financial Companies) are fast emerging as
                    an important segment of Indian financial system. It is a
                    heterogeneous group of institutions (other than commercial
                    and co-operative banks) performing financial intermediation
                    in a variety of ways, like accepting deposits, making loans
                    and advances, leasing, hire purchase, etc. They cannot have
                    certain activities as their principal business—agricultural,
                    industrial and sale-purchase or construction of immovable
                    property
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It is mandatory for a NBFC to get itself registered with the
                    RBI as a deposit taking company. For registration they need
                    to be a company (incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956)
                    and should have a minimum NOF (net owned fund) ₹2 crore.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Some of the important regulations relating to acceptance of
                    deposits by the NBFCs are:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
