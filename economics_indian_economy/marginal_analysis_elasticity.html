                <h1 class="title">Marginal Analysis and Elasticity</h1>
                <p>
                  For economists, the word "marginal" is pretty much the same as
                  "additional". Marginal analysis looks at how individuals,
                  businesses and governments make decisions. Basically, they're
                  interested in <b>additional benefits</b> and
                  <b>additional costs</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Businesses do the same thing when they decide how many workers
                  to hire. They compare the additional revenue that an
                  additional worker will likely generate for their company to
                  the additional cost of hiring that worker: wages and benefits.
                  If hiring that worker brings in more marginal revenue than
                  marginal cost, then, they will be employed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This also applies in the realm of how people feel about
                  things. Take the development of city parks: citizens obviously
                  get more total satisfaction from four city parks than from
                  only three. But that doesn't necessarily mean that the
                  government should build four parks. Instead, the government
                  looks at the additional benefit or satisfaction generated by
                  the fourth city park and compares that to the additional cost.
                  If the additional benefit is higher, then they build the park.
                  The government keeps doing this for each additional park. The
                  benefit of the first park is higher than the additional
                  benefit of the second park, and on and on. Eventually, the
                  marginal benefit of another park will be less than the
                  marginal cost - so they stop building parks.
                </p>
                <h3>Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility</h3>
                <p>
                  Sure, it's nice to have lots of parks, but the difference
                  between having 200 parks and 201 parks is pretty small. This
                  is the Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility. By the way, when
                  economists talk about consumers, the word 'utility' means
                  'satisfaction' or happiness people get from consuming a good,
                  or service.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So, you could reword this as the
                  <b>Law of Decreasing Additional Satisfaction</b>. Asume that
                  you like pizza, as you consume more and more of it, you'll get
                  less and less additional satisfaction. The seller knows this,
                  and figures it might be better to charge less for successive
                  pizzas. That's why we have deals like 'Buy two and get the
                  third one free'.
                </p>
                <h3>Supply and Demand and Marginal Analysis</h3>
                <p>
                  Armed with our new knowledge of marginal analysis, let's go
                  back and look at the most important model in microeconomics:
                  supply and demand. Let's use the market for strawberries.
                  Remember, the price of strawberries is on the vertical axis,
                  and quantity is on the horizontal axis.
                </p>
                <div class="img bigimg">
                  <img
                    src="../images/economy/supply&demand1.png"
                    alt="Supply and Demand"
                    style="width: 100%"
                  />
                </div>
                <p>
                  The demand curve for strawberries is downward sloping, showing
                  the Law of Demand. When prices are high, people don't want to
                  buy very many, and when prices are low, people want to buy a
                  lot.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The shape of the demand curve reflects the idea of the law of
                  diminishing marginal utility. The first box of strawberries
                  you buy give you a lot of additional utility. The second one,
                  maybe not as much. And the third one, even less. So, as you
                  consume more, you're willing to pay less and less. This
                  explains why the demand curve is downward sloping and why it's
                  really just a marginal benefit curve.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The supply curve is upward sloping representing the Law of
                  supply. An increase in price gives producers an incentive to
                  produce more. It turns out that supply curves are really just
                  marginal cost curves. It represents the additional amount of
                  resources and energy that each additional box of strawberries
                  costs.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This graph explains why markets tend to be so efficient with
                  our scarce resources.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    If strawberry producers produced too few strawberries, the
                    marginal benefit of the last unit will be greater than the
                    marginal cost. That's the market calling out for more
                    strawberries.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If they produce too much, then the marginal cost would be
                    greater than the marginal benefit, they'd be wasting
                    resources on things that consumers don't value.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Equilibrium is efficient because the marginal benefit of the
                  last unit consumed equals the marginal cost of that unit. The
                  market is making the exact amount that consumers want.

                <h3>Diamond Water Paradox</h3>
                <p>
                  Why are diamonds more expensive than water? Water is
                  absolutely crucial for keeping us alive, while diamonds do
                  nothing except sparkle. This is called the
                  <b>Diamond Water Paradox</b>, and it was explained by Adam
                  Smith with marginal analysis and the law of diminishing
                  utility
                </p>
                <p>
                  The total utility we get from water is very high, but since
                  it's so plentiful for most people, the marginal utility is
                  really low. If you can stay hydrated, cook, take showers, wash
                  your clothes, then the additional satisfaction of yet another
                  gallon of water is small. The result is a lower price.
                </p>

                  On the other hand, diamonds are extremely scarce because they
                  have to be extracted from expensive and dangerous, mines.
                  Since there are relatively few diamonds, the additional
                  satisfaction of another one is relatively high, so people are
                  willing to pay a higher price. If diamonds fell out of the sky
                  like water, we wouldn't get that much additional satisfaction
                  from them, and the price would be low. It might seem
                  irrational that society values diamonds more than water, but
                  using marginal analysis, it sort of makes sense.

                <div class="note">
                  Relative scarcity does contribute to a product's value. But
                  just because something is limited doesn't automatically make
                  it valuable. There are plenty of other things that are scarce
                  that we don't value as much as diamonds.

                <h2>The Substitution Effect and Elasticity</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>

                <p>
                  The demand also depends on the number of substitutes. For
                  example, strawberries have plenty of substitute goods -
                  cherries, blueberries. When the price goes up for
                  strawberries, consumers buy less because they'll go buy
                  something else instead. This is a substitution effect and
                  along with the law of diminishing marginal utility, it helped
                  shape the demand curve.
                </p>
                <h3>Elasticity of Demand</h3>
                <p>
                  On the other hand, take petrol or diesel for example. When
                  their prices goes up, people don’t stop buying, because they
                  need it and there are few close substitutes. Economists would
                  say that the demand for gasoline is
                  <b>relatively inelastic</b>: a large percent change in price
                  leads to a small percent change in the quantity demanded. This
                  is shown on the graph by making the demand curve steeper,
                  other products that have that have relatively inelastic demand
                  include electricity, healthcare etc. There are few products
                  that have <b>perfectly inelastic demand</b>, if the price goes
                  up people who can afford it will always buy the same amount,
                  an example is insulin for diabetics because in that case they
                  need it to live.
                </p>
                <p>
                  What about the demand for strawberries? Well there are many
                  close substitutes. So, a small increase in the strawberries
                  could cause the price to decrease a lot. For strawberries the
                  demand curve would be flatter, showing the demand for
                  strawberries is <b>relatively elastic</b>.
                </p>
                <h3>Elasticity of Supply</h3>
                <p>
                  There’s also elasticity of supply. A steep curve shows the
                  supply is relatively inelastic, so a large change in price,
                  leads to a small change in quantity. Like an airplane is
                  difficult and time consuming to build, so even if a buyer
                  willing to pay more for one, they’re still going to have to
                  wait.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Relatively elastic supply is when quantity is sensitive to a
                  change in price because producers can respond quickly, stuff
                  like t-shirts and strawberries. Something like the supply of
                  Vincent Van Gogh paintings are perfectly inelastic because
                  when the price goes up, the quantity doesn’t change. It
                  doesn’t matter if people want more, Van Gogh is not around
                  anymore to paint.
