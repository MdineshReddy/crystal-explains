                <p>
                  Economics is about choices, and how we use our scarce
                  resources. It’s not just about producing and consuming, it can
                  also be about conserving. Maybe counter-intuitively, economics
                  has a lot to add to discussions of how we can balance our
                  desire for prosperity and growth, with the need to protect our
                  natural resources. In this article, we're going to look at
                  environmental economics and think about how economics can help
                  us keep our planet livable.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Pollution is going to happen, it’s a by-product of human
                  existence and there is no way that we can get rid of it all.
                  For sake of simplicity, we’re going to focus on one type of
                  pollution: carbon dioxide emissions. They’re one of the
                  primary greenhouse gases. These greenhouse gases basically
                  blanket the earth and are causing climate change. CO2 levels
                  are the highest they've been for millions of years which is
                  why environmentalists consider it a “planetary emergency.”
                  There is a lot of effort going into how to remove greenhouse
                  gases from the atmosphere, how to make cities more resilient
                  to climate change, but in the interest of time we’re going to
                  focus on efforts to reduce the amount of new pollutants
                  getting spewed into our atmosphere.
                </p>
                <p>The economic solution is pretty simple:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Step one, identify the sources of the most air pollution.
                    Done. We know exactly what it is. It’s factories that burn
                    fossil fuels for energy, industries that use oil and coal to
                    produce things, and vehicles with internal combustion
                    engines.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Step two, decrease the supply of these technologies and
                    products or decrease the demand for them.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  That’s it, it’s simple. But, the implementation of these
                  policies gets complicated. Let’s look at decreasing supply.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    As we mentioned in the
                    <a href='/economics_indian_economy/market_economics.html#tragedy_of_commons'>Market Economics</a
                    >
                    article, one of the biggest problems with having countries
                    independently enforce environmental regulations is the
                    Tragedy of the Commons. No one owns the atmosphere, so there
                    is very little incentive for countries to keep it clean and
                    switch to expensive green technologies, if no one else is
                    going to.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The other option is to decrease the demand for fossil fuels,
                    possibly by finding alternate green energy sources. But
                    we’re already very reliant on fossil fuels, and markets have
                    made the production of those fuels very cheap. So, any new
                    type of energy will have a hard time beating the established
                    system.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  So, we can either wait patiently for new technologies to
                  develop and get cheaper, or we can speed up the process by
                  manipulating markets with government subsidies, taxes, and
                  regulations. In the case of pollution, there are long-term
                  side effects, like climate change, that consumers often don’t
                  take into account when they buy products.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Pollution represents a market failure- a situation where
                  markets fail to produce the amount that society wants. To
                  address this, some economists argue that government
                  intervention is not only justified, but essential. There are
                  all kinds of different ways intervention can happen — all of
                  them meant to encourage producers and consumers to choose to
                  pollute less.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    One solution is for the government to come out and set very
                    specific rules about how much specific industries can
                    pollute.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Another way government encourage people to pollute less is
                    by providing price incentives. Those incentives can
                    encourage individuals to make choices that are better for
                    the environment. The government could add taxes to gasoline
                    purchases, or, on the other hand, provide subsidies for
                    people who drive electric cars.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Governments can also create permit markets — basically setting
                  a limit on how much firms can pollute, and allowing those
                  firms to buy and sell pollution permits. You’ve probably heard
                  these called “cap and trade”. Proponents of cap and trade
                  argue that it can successfully limit emissions, without
                  creating hard and fast rules that might hinder economic
                  growth. And, governments can subsidize the development of a
                  specific technology or industry—in an effort to make that
                  technology more competitive with the alternatives.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A country might help support the development of solar or wind
                  energy. Current predictions are that by 2040 15% of the world
                  energy consumption will come from renewable sources. But,
                  alternative energy sources, for the most part, just aren’t
                  cheap enough yet, so the majority of our energy is likely to
                  continue to come from non-renewable sources, at least for now.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We don’t have the time to sit back and wait for new
                  technologies to get cheaper, and there's no guarantee that the
                  technologies that the government picks will be cost effective.
                  Perhaps the solution is not to get rid of fossil fuels, but
                  instead be more efficient with those fuels. But that has
                  drawbacks, too. Some energy economists argue that the expected
                  gains from energy saving technologies, are offset by something
                  called the <b>rebound effect</b>. Let's understand this with
                  an example.

                    Let’s say, John uses a gallon of gas to drive to work every
                    day. Then, partially to help the planet but mostly to help
                    his wallet, he buys a new fuel-efficient car that only takes
                    half a gallon of gas for the same commute. He saves money
                    and there's less pollution. It is a win-win.

                    But the rebound effect says that the benefits of energy
                    efficiency might be reduced as people change their behavior.
                    With the money he saves, John might start driving more than
                    he normally would. That leads to more consumption and
                    possibly even more emissions. Also, if greater
                    fuel-efficiency makes driving less expensive it might
                    encourage more people to buy cars and increase the overall
                    use of gasoline. And even if people didn't increase their
                    driving, the new fuel efficiency could decrease the demand
                    for gas, making fossil fuels cheaper and more readily
                    available for other uses.

                    The possibility of the rebound effect doesn’t mean we
                    shouldn’t invest in energy saving technologies. It just
                    means that we have to keep in mind how consumers will
                    behave. It’s also the reason why it's important to have
                    economists involved in the discussion about environmental
                    policy. The tools of economics can help analyze the
                    incentives and figure out what might work best.

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>
                  Most countries are actively trying to address the problem of
                  greenhouse gases. The international community has been trying
                  for decades to work together to protect the environment with
                  varying success. There are international treaties that commit
                  countries to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Both private
                  companies and governments are also funding research into green
                  technology. So, now that most countries recognize there is a
                  problem, the hope is that they’ll figure out a way, or more
                  likely a lot of ways, to start addressing it.
                </p>

                  Environmental economists say that is not just governments and
                  producers that need to change, it’s also consumers. Conserving
                  and consuming more thoughtfully likely need to be a part of
                  our daily lives if we want to protect the environment.
