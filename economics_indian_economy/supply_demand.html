                <p>
                  Probably the most important concept of microeconomics, supply
                  and demand is a theory that explains the interaction between
                  the sellers of a resource and the buyers for that resource.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Let's use the market for strawberries to help us understand
                  this concept. On the Y axis, we have the price of
                  strawberries, On the X axis we have the quantity of boxes of
                  strawberries.
                </p>
                <div class="img bigimg">
                  <img
                    src="../images/economy/supply&demand1.png"
                    alt="Supply and Demand"
                    style="width: 100%"
                  />
                </div>
                <p>
                  Let's start by looking at buyers and how they respond to a
                  change in price. If the price goes up for strawberries, then
                  some buyers will go buy some other fruit. And if the price
                  goes down for strawberries, then people are going to buy more.
                  This is called the <b>law of demand</b>: when the price goes
                  up, people buy less, when the price goes down, people buy
                  more. On the graph it's shown by a
                  <b>downward sloping demand curve</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Now let's think about sellers like the farmer in the farmer's
                  market. If the price of strawberries goes up, then that farmer
                  will make more profit, so he will have an incentive to produce
                  more strawberries. If the price goes down then he's not going
                  to produce strawberries. That's called the
                  <b>law of supply</b>, and on the graph, it's shown by an
                  <b>upward sloping supply curve</b>.
                </p>
                <h3>Surplus, Shortage and Equilibrium</h3>
                <p>
                  If the price is really high then producers would like to
                  produce a lot of strawberries, but consumers won't want to buy
                  them. This mismatch is called a <b>surplus</b>. If the price
                  goes down for strawberries, then buyers want to buy a whole
                  lot, but producers won't have incentive and they'll produce
                  very little. At the end you have mismatch, but this one's
                  called a <b>shortage</b>. There's only one price where the
                  quantity that buyers want to buy is exactly equal to the
                  quantity that sellers want to sell, and it's when supply
                  equals demand. The price is called the
                  <b>equilibrium price</b>, and the quantity is called the
                  <b>equilibrium quantity</b>.
                </p>
                <div class="img bigimg">
                  <img
                    src="../images/economy/supply&demand2.png"
                    alt="Supply and Demand"
                    style="width: 100%"
                  />
                </div>
                <h3>Effect of External Factors</h3>
                <p>
                  The above graph makes sense in normal times, but the price of
                  strawberries isn't always constant; sometimes it goes up and
                  sometimes it goes down. In fact, the prices for all sort of
                  stuff change all the time. External forces can shift both the
                  supply and demand curves, changing the equilibrium price and
                  quantity.
                </p>

                <p>
                  For example, let's assume that the above graphs show the
                  demand and supply of strawberries in the summer. What happens
                  in the winter? Colder temperatures make it harder to grow
                  strawberries. The result is the entire supply curve is going
                  to shift to the left. This is because at all possible prices,
                  there'd be fewer strawberries produced.
                </p>
                <div class="img bigimg">
                  <img
                    src="../images/economy/supply&demand3.png"
                    alt="Supply and Demand"
                    style="width: 100%"
                  />
                </div>
                <p>
                  Supply and demand model apply to analyzing all sorts of stuff.
                  In fact, let's look at a market for a commodity known for its
                  volatility because of its fluctuating prices: gasoline. When
                  you see gas prices are moving all over the board, that's just
                  demand and supply. For example, in 2014, the retail gas price
                  fell dramatically. Why? Well, it was demand and supply. The
                  economies of both Europe and China weakened, which decreased
                  the demand for gasoline, shifting the demand curve to the
                  left. At the same time, new fracking technology and restored
                  production of oil in Iraq and Libya caused the supply of
                  gasoline to increase, or shift to the right. The combination
                  drove gas prices down by more than 40% per gallon.
                </p>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                  That's it. This graph is just a tool that economists use to
                  show the results of a change in a market. Even though supply
                  and demand behave in a predictable way that we've seen in the
                  models, we can't lose sight of the fact that both of them are
                  reliant on humans acting as buyers and sellers. Our actions
                  influence supply and demand in a way that is more often
                  unpredictable.
