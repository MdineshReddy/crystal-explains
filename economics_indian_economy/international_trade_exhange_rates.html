                <h1 class="title">International Trade and Exchange Rates</h1>
                <p>
                  International trade is the lifeblood of the global economy.
                  Basically, when a good or service is produced in, let's say
                  South Korea, and sold to a person or business, say in India,
                  that counts as an export for South Korea and an import for
                  India.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The annual difference between a country's exports and imports
                  is called <b>net exports</b>. So, if South Korea exports 250
                  billion dollars' worth of goods and imports 200 billion, then
                  its net exports are 50 billion. That means South Korea has a
                  <b>trade surplus</b>. In case, if the net exports were
                  negative, then its called a <b>trade deficit</b>.
                </p>
                <h3>Trade Deficit and Impact of International Trade</h3>
                <p>
                  Some people assume that having a trade deficit is inherently
                  bad. Like for example, U.S. import nearly all of its clothing.
                  U.S. producers could easily make more than enough clothing,
                  but they don't because they focus on other things that they're
                  better at producing. The U.S. buys its clothes from other
                  countries because it's cheaper. This is the value of
                  international trade. It doesn't make sense to make everything
                  on your own if you can trade with other countries that have a
                  comparative advantage.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It can seem like exporting would make a country wealthy, while
                  importing would make it poor. After all, if we buy products
                  produced in other countries, then we're shipping jobs
                  overseas, right? Well, only to an extent. Imagine you had the
                  choice of buying a TV made in India or a TV made in China.
                  Because of lower labor costs in China, the imported TV costs ₹
                  10000 less than the Indian made one. So, you buy the imported
                  TV (not considering the patriotism factor). That might cost
                  jobs at a TV factory in the India., but you saved ₹ 10000 by
                  buying the imported TV. You will be spending that ₹ 10000 on
                  something you couldn't have afforded if you bought the Indian
                  TV. Like taking your family to a nice restaurant. That creates
                  jobs in those industries that wouldn't have existed if you
                  would've bought the more expensive TV.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Economic theory suggests that
                  <b
                    >international trade reshuffles jobs from one sector of the
                    economy to another</b
                  >. Like from the TV factory to the restaurant. But the quality
                  of these jobs can be markedly different. The guy assembling
                  TVs at the Indian factory was probably making a lot more at
                  his manufacturing job before he got reshuffled to a restaurant
                  job. Which is just to say that all this is really complicated
                  and what is good in the aggregate is not necessarily good for
                  individuals.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The debate over the value of specific trade agreements
                  continues, but it's unlikely that the world's largest
                  economies will return to strict protectionism. Protectionist
                  policy, like placing high tariffs on imports and limiting the
                  number of foreign goods, usually hurts an economy more than it
                  helps.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There are now several organizations designed to eradicate
                  protectionism, most notably the World Trade Organization, or
                  WTO. The WTO has been effective in getting countries to agree
                  to specific rules and help settle disputes. But it's also been
                  accused of favoring rich countries and not doing enough to
                  help the environment or workers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Trade between countries depends on the demand for a country's
                  goods, political stability and interest rates. But one of the
                  most important factors is exchange rates. Basically, this is
                  how much your currency is worth when you trade it for another
                  country's currency.
                </p>
                <h3>Currency Exchange</h3>
                <p>
                  Suppose the U.S./India exchange rate is 70 rupees to the
                  dollar. If an American is on vacation in India and wants to
                  buy some sunscreen that costs 280 rupees, they'll have to
                  trade 4 dollars for rupees. Likewise, if someone from India is
                  on vacation in the U.S. and wants to buy a 20-dollar t-shirt,
                  she will have to exchange 1400 rupees for dollars.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Now, let's think about what happens if the exchange rate goes
                  up to 140 rupees per dollar. Now to buy that 280 rupees
                  sunscreen in India, it'll cost that American two dollars
                  instead of four. We say that the dollar has appreciated. At
                  the same time, the Indian tourist who wants to buy the
                  20-dollar t-shirt will need 2,800 rupees instead of 1400. In
                  this case the rupee depreciated.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It works the same way with imports and exports. When the
                  rupees depreciates, foreign imports get more expensive, which
                  makes them fall and Indian exports to other countries gets
                  cheaper, which means they rise.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On the other hand, what if the exchange rate fell to 35 rupees
                  per dollar? Now to buy that sunscreen, the American tourist
                  needs 8 dollars. Each dollar has gotten less powerful i.e.,
                  depreciated. At the same time, the Indian tourist who wants to
                  buy the 20-dollar t-shirt needs only 700 rupees. In this case
                  rupee appreciated.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So, when the rupee appreciates, it gets cheaper for Indian
                  consumers to import foreign goods and Indian exports to other
                  countries get more expensive. Indian imports rise and exports
                  fall.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Most currencies like the rupee and the dollar have
                  <b>floating exchange rates</b> that change based on supply and
                  demand. When the U.S. imports more products from India, they
                  exchange dollars for rupees. This will increase the demand for
                  rupees, and the rupee will appreciate. At the same time, the
                  dollar will depreciate.

                  Some countries have elected to peg their currency to another
                  currency. This is when a country's central bank wants to keep
                  the exchange rate in a certain range. And they buy or sell
                  currencies to keep it in that range. The Chinese government
                  was well known for buying U.S. dollars to keep the Chinese
                  currency artificially depreciated. When the U.S. imported
                  goods from China, the yuan would appreciate. Then the Chinese
                  government would turn around and buy dollars, which kept the
                  exchange rate about the same. This kept Chinese exports cheap
                  for Americans.

                <h3>Balance of Payments</h3>
                <p>
                  Up to this point, we focused on importing and exporting goods
                  and services, but there's a whole other side of international
                  trade that involves financial assets. Let's look at something
                  called the balance of payments.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Every country keeps an accounting statement called the balance
                  of payments that records all international transaction. It's
                  made up of two sub accounts:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><b>the current account</b> and</li>
                  <li>
                    <b>the financial account</b>, sometimes called the
                    <b>capital account</b> .
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  The current account records the sale and purchase of goods and
                  services, investment income earned abroad and other transfers
                  like donations and foreign aid. So, when the U.S. buys 50
                  billion dollars of computers from China, that's recorded in
                  the U.S. current account. This is a simplification, but when
                  Americans spend money on Chinese goods, the people in China,
                  in theory, have only two things they can do with that money.
                  They can buy U.S. goods or they can buy U.S. financial assets
                  like stocks and bonds. These transactions are recorded in the
                  other sub account: the financial account.
                </p>
                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                  International trade, like everything else in economics, is
                  about trade-offs and choices and winners and losers. In purely
                  economic terms, trade deficits and surpluses are the result of
                  people and nations seeking their own self-interest. But while
                  everyone is acting in a self-interested way, international
                  trade doesn't always meet our individual interests. What may
                  be good for the wider global economy might be really bad for
                  you or your hometown. But in the aggregate, trade does improve
                  the global standard of living. It's just sometimes hard to see
                  up close.
