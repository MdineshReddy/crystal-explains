                <h1 class="title">Behavioral Economics</h1>
                <p>
                  When economists make their models, they generally assume that
                  people are rational and predictable. But when we look at
                  actual human beings, it turns out that people are impulsive,
                  shortsighted, and, a lot of times, just plain irrational. In
                  this article, we will take a look at Behavioral Economics and
                  how people actually make decisions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Behavioral economics is a subfield of economics that focuses
                  on the psychological, social, and emotional factors that
                  influence decision-making. That's not necessarily new. In
                  fact, Adam Smith discussed it in
                  <b>The Theory of Moral Sentiments</b> in 1759. But generations
                  of economists chose to ignore many irrational elements of
                  decision making, since it makes it harder to predict human
                  behavior. But in the last few decades, behavioral economics
                  has made a comeback. Several Nobel Prizes have been awarded to
                  researchers that blend economics and psychology and behavioral
                  economics is being applied to more and more fields like
                  marketing, finance, political science, and public policy.
                </p>
                <h3>Bounded Rationality</h3>
                <p>
                  In most cases, people are rational. When the price falls for a
                  product, people tend to buy more of that product, so the law
                  of demand holds true. But economists also accept that there is
                  <b>bounded rationality</b>. Limits on information, time, and
                  abilities might prevent people from seeking out the best
                  possible outcome.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For example, if the price for ice cream is really low,
                  consumers might not buy more. In fact, they might buy less if
                  they think that that low price means that ice cream tastes
                  horrible. If that happens, then the law of demand doesn’t hold
                  true, which creates a serious problem for classical economics.
                  After all, it is the "LAW" of demand. You can’t have a
                  situation that breaks the law and still call it a law. That
                  doesn’t happen in other disciplines like physics…except it
                  does. The Newtonian laws of physics, like gravity, hold true
                  most of the time but they break down at the quantum level.
                  They explain the orbits of planets, but they have a harder
                  time explaining the orbits of electrons. And It’s the same in
                  economics. Classical economic theories explain the big picture
                  stuff pretty well, but there are still a lot of things about
                  individual decision-making that we just don’t fully
                  understand.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In our ice cream example, one of the problems is lack of
                  information. Classical economics assumes that consumers have
                  perfect information when making choices. That is, they know or
                  at least can quickly access information about prices and
                  quality, but, in reality, they often don’t. Sure, the consumer
                  could ask around or call their friends to see if they’ve tried
                  that type of ice cream, but they're probably not going to do
                  that. In this situation, consumers may act on the limited
                  information they have, a suspiciously low price, which means
                  either the ice cream is a great deal or it tastes bad.
                </p>
                <h3>Perceptions and Passions</h3>
                <p>
                  Prices do send a lot of signals, and there’s even science on
                  how prices change perception. A study in California analyzed
                  the brains of people taste testing a variety of red wines. The
                  researchers gave participants fake prices and scanned their
                  brains to determine the level of enjoyment. The results were
                  surprising. When they thought the price was higher, they
                  actually liked the wine more. This held true even when the
                  subjects were given the exact same type of wine but were told
                  it was a different higher-priced wine.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The idea that perceptions and passions influence our actions
                  also applies in finance. Many economists used to believe that
                  assets, like stocks and real estate, would stay at or near
                  their real value because cold, calculating investors would buy
                  undervalued assets and sell overvalued assets. But that
                  doesn’t explain bubbles: In real life, investors aren’t always
                  cold and calculating. They can get worked up and irrational
                  sometimes. This helps explain bubbles. From the Dutch Tulip
                  Mania of the 17th century, to the 2008 financial crisis.
                  Investors became irrationally exuberant, and were driven not
                  by logic, but by what economist John Maynard Keynes once
                  called, “Animal Spirits.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  So behavioral economics doesn’t blow up traditional economic
                  theory, it just seeks to understand when and why people behave
                  differently than economic models suggest.
                </p>
                <h3>Ultimatum Game</h3>
                <p>
                  One of the most popular experiments in behavioral economics is
                  called the ultimatum game. In this experiment, two players
                  decide how to share a specific sum of money, let’s say ₹ 100.
                  The first player is given all the money and then is asked to
                  propose a way of splitting it with the second player. If the
                  second player accepts the deal both players get to keep the
                  money. But, if the second player refuses, nobody gets to keep
                  the money. When the first player offers to split the money
                  50/50 the second player almost always accepts. But what
                  happens when the first player offers an unequal split, like
                  80/20? Would you accept that offer? Well, it turns out that
                  less equal offers are often rejected. That doesn’t seem
                  surprising, but it directly contradicts classical economic
                  theory. It’s irrational.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The rational choice would be for the second player to accept
                  any offer, even if it's only a rupee. After all, a rupee is
                  better than nothing. But human behavior is not motivated
                  solely by gain; it’s also shaped by complex ideas like
                  fairness, injustice, and even revenge.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The ultimatum game shows that people aren’t always as
                  predictable as many economists like to suggest. If people were
                  entirely rational then they would consistently make the same
                  decision given identical options, but sometimes people's
                  preferences are dependent on how the options are presented.
                  Psychologists call this type of cognitive bias the Framing
                  Effect.

                  I mean, would you rather eat meat that's 75% fat free or 25%
                  fat? Would you rather enter a lottery that claims that 1 out
                  of every 1000 players is a winner or a lottery that points out
                  that there will be 999 losers. Would you support a law named
                  the “Improve our Schools Act” or one named the “Raise our
                  Taxes Act”? Each of these scenarios can be framed in ways that
                  influence your decision. Classical economics argues that
                  framing should have relatively little effect on decision
                  making because most people are rational and intelligent, but
                  in the real world, people can be pretty irrational.

                <h3>psychological pricing</h3>
                <p>
                  Businesses have known about the psychology of decision making
                  for a long time. For example, a gym might break down its
                  membership fee and advertise it only costs only ₹ 50 a day,
                  which seems way more affordable than ₹ 18,250 a year. And a TV
                  priced at ₹ 49,999 seems like a better deal than one priced at
                  ₹ 50,000. This is called
                  <b>psychological pricing</b>. It can make people feel like
                  they’re getting a good deal. Interestingly, high-end retailers
                  sometimes do the opposite. They set their prices at whole
                  dollars, basically signaling their goods are of a higher
                  quality than you might see at a discount store.

                <h3>Nudge Theory</h3>
                <p>
                  Behavioral economists also like to talk about nudge theory.
                  Nudges encourage people to act a certain way, without actually
                  changing the choices that are available to them. Fighting
                  childhood obesity is a priority in many developed countries
                  and policy makers have suggested a whole range of solutions.
                  Everything from banning soda in schools to running media
                  campaigns promoting healthy eating. Behavioral economists
                  approached the problem a little differently. They wanted to
                  see if they could get children to eat healthier by rearranging
                  school cafeterias. They put healthier food like fruits and
                  vegetables on eye-level shelves and less healthy foods, like
                  desserts, in less convenient places. Classical economic theory
                  suggests that this idea wouldn’t work since rational people
                  would pick the desserts. But it turns out, students choose the
                  healthier foods. Nudge theory works and it’s changing how we
                  implement public policy. There are some issues that can be
                  addressed best with the right type of nudge.

                <h3>Risks</h3>
                <p>
                  Let’s talk about something else behavioral economists look at:
                  risk. Let’s say someone offered you two sealed envelopes. One
                  has a thousand rupees, and one has no money. You can choose an
                  envelope, or you can take hundred rupees cash right now. So,
                  do you take the hundred rupees? How about 99 rupees?
                </p>
                <p>
                  This is unlikely to happen to you in real life, but the
                  exercise is about your attitude towards risk. Since there’s a
                  50/50 chance of getting ₹ 1000 or nothing, the expected
                  return, or the average of the possible outcomes is ₹ 100. If
                  you’re willing to accept ₹ 100 cash to abandon the envelopes,
                  then you’re <b>risk neutral</b>. But If you accept less than ₹
                  100, just to avoid walking away with nothing, then you’re
                  <b>risk-averse</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Behavioral economists have done lots of studies about risk and
                  in particular loss aversion, the idea that people strongly
                  want to avoid losing. Studies show that, in general, losses
                  are more painful than gains are pleasurable. So, people might
                  choose a safe course of action even if it’s not the most
                  logical choice. Let’s say we flip a coin and if it’s heads, I
                  give you ₹ 100 but if it’s tails, you have to give me ₹ 50.
                  Now, mathematically you should go for it. But many people
                  won’t. They want to avoid losing.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Understanding of loss aversion can help businesses and
                  policymakers influence decisions. For example, some grocery
                  stores in the Washington DC, tried to decrease the use of
                  disposable plastic bags by offering five cent bonuses if
                  customers brought reusable bags. The policy didn’t do that
                  much. Later they tried a five-cent tax on plastic bags, and,
                  this time, people used fewer disposable bags. This is loss
                  aversion at work. The pain of having to pay 5 cents per bag
                  was greater than the benefit of receiving 5 cents per bag.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Another study analyzed how loss aversion can help incentivize
                  employees. Researchers divided workers into three groups. The
                  first was a control group that wasn’t given a bonus. The
                  second group was promised a bonus at the end of the year based
                  on meeting specific goals. Participants in third group were
                  given the bonus at the beginning of the year and were told
                  that they would have to pay it back, if they didn’t meet
                  specific goals. The workers in the first and second groups
                  performed about the same, but those in the third group
                  performed significantly better. We just hate losing.
                </p>
                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                  So, behavioral economics has a lot to tell us. Accounting for
                  emotion just gives us a realistic view of how people actually
                  behave. We might not always be the rational actors, classical
                  economists believe us to be. For years, economics has had a
                  blind spot. But behavioral economics helps us get a better
                  look at how we make decisions.
