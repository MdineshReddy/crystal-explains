                <h2>Economic Growth</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>
                  Economic growth is a quantitative concept. In simple terms,
                  economic growth is the increase in the monetary value of the
                  goods and services produced by an economy over time. A common
                  economic index for measurement of growth of a nationâ€™s economy
                  is the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Growth is a value neutral term i.e.; it might be positive or
                  negative for an economy over a period of time. But generally,
                  we use it in positive sense. Increasing growth of an economy
                  signifies wellbeing of that economy.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When the output of economy is increasing, but the rate of
                  increase is decreasing over previous quarter/half year/year,
                  then it is referred to as 'growth rate is slowing down'.
                  Output declining over same reference period is referred to as
                  <b>contraction</b> whereas continuous periods of contraction
                  over two quarters (six months) is known as
                  <b>recession</b> and still longer periods of continuous
                  recession is known as <b>Depression</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Economic growth is useful not only in national level economic
                  analysis and policy-making, but also highly useful in the
                  study of comparative economics. International financial and
                  commercial institutions go for policy-making and future
                  financial planning on the basis of growth rate data available
                  for the economies of world.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Increased growth means increased output and increased income
                  for factors of production which sets off a
                  <b>virtuous cycle of growth in an economy</b>.
                </p>
                <h2>Economic Development</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>
                  Economic development is a much broader term which indicates
                  how the output of an economy is distributed among its people.
                  India's GDP is over six times larger than the GDP of
                  Singapore, but that doesn't mean the average Indian is richer
                  than the average Singaporean. That's because India has 240
                  times more people than Singapore.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So, economists look at something called GDP per capita, to
                  determine how wealthy a country is. GDP per capita is the GDP
                  of the country divided by its population. It represents output
                  per person, and a country with a high GDP per capita is
                  considered rich. Even GDP per capita is not an exhaustive
                  measurement, since it does not account for concentration of
                  wealth in few individuals. But it is the best measurement we
                  have got for now.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Of course, some of you may say being rich has nothing to do
                  with GDP or money. It has to do with whether or not you're
                  happy. Fine, money may not buy happiness, but it can prevent a
                  lot of misery. The
                  <b>United Nations' Human Development Index</b>, or HDI,
                  measures life expectancy, literacy, education, quality of
                  life, and it ranks countries according to their findings. The
                  data shows the country that have a high GDP per capita have
                  far less infant mortality, poverty and preventable diseases.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So, economists often used GDP per capita to measure a
                  country's standard of living. Countries with the lowest
                  standard of living are the ones that are conventionally
                  considered poor.

                  <h3 style="text-align: center">Gross National Happiness</h3>
                  <p>
                    Bhutan, our neighbouring Himalayan kingdom and an economic
                    non-entity, developed a new concept of assessing development
                    in the early 1970sâ€”the Gross National Happiness (GNH).
                    Without rejecting the idea of human development propounded
                    by UNDP, the kingdom has been officially following the
                    targets set by the GNH. Bhutan has been following the GNH
                    since 1972 which has the following parameters to attain
                    happiness/development:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Higher real per capita income</li>
                    <li>Good governance</li>
                    <li>Environmental protection</li>
                    <li>
                      Cultural promotion (i.e.., inculcation of ethical and
                      spiritual values in life without which, it says, progress
                      may become a curse rather than a blessing)
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </div>
                <h2>Growth vs Development</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>
                  Earlier, it was believed that increased growth would
                  automatically lead to betterment of lives of people. But in
                  case of India, it has not worked due to various reasons.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the absence of development, the masses are to be guaranteed
                  with a basic minimum level of quality life based upon the
                  entitlement or welfare approach. For this, a minimum level of
                  income has to be generated from productive activities by
                  expanding the industries and services sectors. Thus, while
                  there can be growth without development, development without
                  growth is unconceivable.
                </p>
                <h3>Sen-Bhagwati Debate on Growth Vs Development</h3>
                <p>
                  The debate between two of the finest Indian economistsâ€”Amartya
                  Sen and Jagdish Bhagwati on Economic Policy of India and
                  offering prescriptions for Indiaâ€™s governance priorities.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Amartya Sen believes that India should invest more in its
                  social infrastructure to boost the productivity of its people
                  and thereby, raise growth. He said that without investing in
                  health and education to improve human capabilities, inequality
                  will widen and the growth process itself will falter. Senâ€™s
                  approach has also been referred to as the capability approach.
                  Sen had upheld what he calls the Kerala Experience where high
                  social spending has resulted in growth, as a role model for
                  other states to follow.

                  Jagdish Bhagwati on the other hand, argues that only increased
                  growth can yield adequate resources for investing in human
                  welfare. Growth may initially raise inequality but sustained
                  growth will eventually raise enough resources for the state to
                  redistribute and mitigate the effects of the initial
                  inequality. He endorses the Gujarat Model as a metaphor for a
                  primarily growth and private entrepreneurship driven
                  development and the Kerala Model for a primarily
                  redistribution and state-driven development.
