                <h2>What is Economics?</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>
                  “Economics is the study of how societies use scarce resources
                  to produce valuable commodities and distribute them among
                  different people.” is one of the formal definitions to
                  Economics.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In simple terms, economics is the study of people and their
                  choices. The famous economist Alfred Marsh defined economics
                  as “A study of mankind in the ordinary business of life. It
                  inquires how a person gets his/her income and how he/she uses
                  it. Thus, it is on the one side, the study of wealth and on
                  the other and more important side, a study of mankind.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  So, let's think about what else economics is. Economics is an
                  18-year-old deciding whether to work or go to college and how
                  that affects his/her future income. Economics is a company
                  deciding whether to produce smartphones or tablets and how
                  that's influenced by what the consumers want to buy. Economics
                  is the government deciding whether to increase its spending
                  when it's a recession and if it's worth going into debt.
                </p>
                <h3>Opportunity Cost and Cost-Benefit Analysis</h3>
                <p>
                  No matter who you are, you will be using economics. In fact,
                  you are using economics right now, you made a choice to read
                  this article, that means you must feel that the benefit
                  outweighs the cost. You might be thinking "There's no cost in
                  learning!" but sure there is. You could spend this time
                  watching a movie or doing something else. The cost of reading
                  this article is the movie you are not watching, the value of
                  the next best alternative. Economists call this your
                  <b>opportunity cost</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We have just covered the two most important assumptions in all
                  of economics.
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    First, the idea of scarcity. People have unlimited wants but
                    limited resources, and
                  </li>
                  <li>Second, Everything and I mean everything has a cost.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                  And if these assumptions are true, then we need a way to
                  analyze our choices and get the most from our limited
                  resources. And that's economics.
                </p>
                <h3>Micro Economics and Macro Economics</h3>
                <p>
                  Micro Economics examines the economic behavior of an
                  individual person, firm, consumer or worker. It is concerned
                  with how supply and demand interaction in individual market
                  and how these interactions determine the price level of goods
                  and services. Micro Economists try and answer questions such
                  as "How many workers should we hire to maximize profit?" and
                  "If our main competitor releases their product in May, when is
                  the best time to release our product?" and so on.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Macro Economics studies the economy as a whole. It looks at
                  the whole nation's output, unemployment, interest rates,
                  government spending, and growth. Macro Economists answer
                  questions such as "Will unemployment rise if there's an
                  increase in taxes?", "Will and increase in the money supply
                  boost output or just increase inflation?", "Which is better
                  for fighting climate change, increase in fuel tax, or increase
                  in fuel efficiency?" and so on. It wasn't until the Great
                  Depression in the 1930's that economists fully appreciated the
                  need for a systematic way to measure the overall economy, and
                  that we might need theories to guide policies and fix
                  potential problems.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So macro and micro-economists are two different groups asking
                  different questions under one academic umbrella. If economics
                  was biology, macroeconomics would be ecology while
                  microeconomics would be cell biology.
                </p>
                <h2>What is Economy?</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>
                  Economy is economics in action. A country, a company and a
                  family all have their economies. It is popularly used in case
                  of countries— Indian economy, the US economy etc. While the
                  principles and theories of economics remain the same,
                  economies (of countries) show diversities given the
                  socioeconomic diversities countries have.
                </p>
                <h3>Sectors of Economy</h3>
                <p>
                  Economic activities in a country/economy are broadly divided
                  into three main sectors:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <b>Primary Sector:</b> The economic activities which take
                    place while exploiting the natural resources fall under it,
                    such as mining, agricultural activities, oil exploration,
                    etc. When agriculture sector (one of the sub-sectors of the
                    primary sector) contributes minimum half of the national
                    income and livelihood in a country it is called an agrarian
                    economy.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Secondary Sector:</b> It contains all of the economic
                    activities under which the raw materials extracted out of
                    the primary sector are processed (also called industrial
                    sector). One of its sub-sectors, manufacturing, has proved
                    to be the largest employer across the western developed
                    Economies. When secondary sector brings in minimum half of
                    the national income and employment in a country it is called
                    an industrial economy.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Tertiary Sector:</b> All of the economic activities where
                    services are produced falls in this sector, such as
                    education, healthcare, banking, communication, etc. When
                    this sector contributes minimum half of the national income
                    and livelihood in a country it is called a service economy.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Economic Systems or Types of Economies</h3>
                <p>
                  Based on who owns or controls the factors of production (land,
                  labor and capital) and mode of distribution (through market or
                  direct), economic systems are of three types namely Planned
                  Economy, Market Economy and Mixed Economy.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b> Planned Economy </b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In a planned economy, the government controls the factors of
                  production. It is often misunderstood as communism and
                  socialism.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <b>Communism:</b> According to Karl Marx, the theory of
                    communism may be summed up in the single sentence:
                    "abolition of private property." So true Communism is a
                    classless society. When we say classless, it means a social
                    order where everyone owns the factors of production, and
                    output is distributed equally. Kind of like what China, Cuba
                    and the former Soviet Union envisioned. In practice,
                    however, no country has ever been truly communist.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Socialism</b>: There's a lot of countries that are
                    socialist. Often, socialism has both private property and
                    some public ownership and control of industry. The goal is
                    to meet specific collective objectives and to provide free
                    and easy access to things like education and healthcare.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  In both communism and socialism, there is economic planning,
                  and the government, usually in the form of some bureaucratic
                  agency, helps decide what to produce, how to produce it, and
                  who gets it. Now if an economy is completely controlled by the
                  government, down to the last detail, that's called a
                  <b>command economy</b> like that of North Korea.
                </p>
                <p><b>Market Economy</b></p>
                <p>
                  On the other side of the spectrum, we have free market
                  economies. In free market or <b>capitalist economies</b>,
                  individuals own the factors of production, and the government
                  adopts a <b>laissez faire</b> or hands-off approach to
                  production, commerce, and trade.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In free market economies, businesses make things like cars,
                  not to do good for mankind but because they want to make a
                  profit. Since consumers get to choose which car they want, car
                  producers need to make a car with the right features at the
                  right price. Economists call this the <b>invisible hand</b>.
                  If consumers prefer one company's car, that business will make
                  more profit and have an incentive to produce more cars. Car
                  companies that don't offer the cars people want will not
                  succeed. This concept applies to all other markets, like cell
                  phones or shoes. Scarce resources will go to the most desired
                  use, and they'll be used efficiently, more or less. After all,
                  if a business is wasteful and inefficient or makes something
                  that no one wants to buy, then some other business will make a
                  similar product that's either better or cheaper or both. If
                  there's no consumer demand for a product, resources won't be
                  wasted producing it.
                </p>
                <div class="note">
                  <p>
                    <b>Why Market Economy is better than Planned Economy?</b>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We often take markets for granted, but look at the
                    alternative. Assume instead that a government agency was in
                    charge of deciding exactly which types of cars and cell
                    phones and shoes to make. Do you think they could quickly
                    respond to changes in tastes and preferences? If there was
                    only one government monopoly producing cars, do you think
                    they'd be produced efficiently?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So, the invisible hand of the free market is the idea that
                    individuals and businesses meet society's needs when they
                    seek their own self-interest. Competitive markets with
                    profit-seeking businesses will have an incentive to produce
                    high-quality products as efficiently as possible.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <b>Need for Government Intervention</b>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If free markets are so perfect why do we even need a
                    government? That's not quite right. There's a bunch of
                    things the government must do, because free markets won't.
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      First, is to maintain the rule of law. We need laws and
                      police and courts to keep everything orderly.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Second, we need public goods and services, like roads and
                      bridges and education and defense, because goods can't get
                      to consumers if bridges are falling down, and consumers
                      can't make good choices if they're not educated, and no
                      one really cares about buying the new iPhone if there's a
                      bomb dropping on your head.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Third, the government sometimes needs to step in when
                      markets get things wrong. Let's understand this with our
                      cars example. When we want to buy a car, we think about
                      what a car looks like, if it's the color we want, if it's
                      safe, what it costs and so on. Most of us aren't worried
                      about air pollution. We don't think much about who made
                      our car, what they were paid, what the conditions at the
                      factory were like; that's when government steps in to
                      regulate production. Cars need to meet strict emissions
                      and safety standards, and there are laws dictating how
                      much manufacturers can pollute and how workers should be
                      treated and how much should they be paid.

                  </ul>
                </div>
                <p><b>Mixed Economy</b></p>

                <p>
                  Modern economies are neither completely free market nor
                  planned. There's a spectrum of government involvement. For
                  example, on one end we have North Korea. They have a command
                  economy where production is entirely controlled by the
                  government. On the other end, we have countries like New
                  Zealand; they have private property, few taxes, and few
                  regulations. In the middle, we have the rest of the world. So
                  most modern economies are actually mixed economies with both
                  free markets and government intervention.
                </p>
                <h3>The Circular Flow Model</h3>
                <p>
                  A modern economy is made up of households (which are
                  individuals like you and me) and businesses. Businesses sell
                  goods and services to households in the product market -
                  that's anywhere goods and services are bought and sold.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The households need to pay for those goods and services, but
                  where do they get the money? The households earn the money by
                  selling the resources, like labor, to businesses. This is done
                  in the resource (or factor) market. The businesses use the
                  money they earn from selling products in the product market to
                  pay for resources in the resource market, and households use
                  the money they earn in the resource market to buy products in
                  the product market.
                </p>
                <div class="img bigimg">

                    style="width: 100%"
                  />
                </div>
                <p>
                  But there's another key player in the economy: the government.
                  The government also buys products and resources. For example,
                  they'll buy cars from businesses and hire government employees
                  like policemen to drive them. The government pays for public
                  goods like roads and bridges and public services like
                  firefighters and teachers. They also provide aid to
                  individuals in poverty and subsidies to businesses to produce
                  things like fuel efficient cars. But where does the government
                  get the money? Well, they get some of it from taxing
                  households and businesses and they get some of it from
                  borrowing. That's the simplified circular flow of how the
                  modern economy works.
                </p>
                <h3>Changing Economies</h3>
                <p>
                  We've established that economies differ based on the amount of
                  government involvement, but it's important to keep in mind
                  that economies can change. Over time, Denmark and Canada have
                  adopted more elements of a planned economy, like universal
                  healthcare. China, on the other hand, has added more free
                  market elements to its economy and now has less government
                  ownership and control of production, so communist China
                  actually has a socialist market economy.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But which type of economy is better and how much should the
                  government get involved? Those who support socialism would
                  point out Denmark's high standards of living and low-income
                  inequality, but free market enthusiasts might point out
                  China's massive economic growth and growing middle class after
                  backing away from central planning.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Ultimately, the optimal amount of government involvement
                  depends on your personal values. For example, what, if
                  anything, do you think the government should do to help people
                  in poverty? Do you think it's up to each individual to provide
                  for themselves, come what may, or do you think the government
                  should step in as a safety net and help pay for food and
                  healthcare? What if the person made choices that got them in
                  financial trouble, like gambling or made them sick, like
                  smoking? Should society help then? Well, economists aren't
                  really good at answering these types of questions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the words of economist Thomas Sowell, "There are no
                  solutions, only trade-offs." Sure, it would be great if we
                  could end poverty or provide healthcare for everyone, but
                  we're going to have to give something up in order to do it.
                  Forcing car producers to meet emissions and safety regulations
                  will increase production costs and likely increase the price
                  of cars, but it also reduces pollution and fossil fuel
                  consumption, which will hopefully improve public health and
                  save money in the long run. There is always an opportunity
                  cost, and deciding if it's worth it is up to you and your
                  elected officials and a bunch of lobbyists.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Deng Xiaoping transformed China from a country with
                  debilitating poverty and famine to the economic powerhouse it
                  is today. Regarding this debate, he said, "It doesn't matter
                  whether a cat is black or white, if it catches mice, it's a
                  good cat."
                </p>
                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                  In practice, almost all countries are somewhere between the
                  extremes of a command economy and a completely free market
                  economy. That's because mixed economies seem best at handling
                  the circular flow of goods, money, and resources. But the
                  debate over free markets and government control will never
                  end. That's why it's vital for you to be informed about the
                  merits and the limits of economic systems and be willing to
                  support solutions that get the job done, as opposed to getting
                  stuck in one ideology.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Economic theories and models can seem really great in the
                  abstract, but when they're kicked out into the real world and
                  actually have to govern the affairs of billions of people, it
                  turns out that some flexibility is a very important thing.
