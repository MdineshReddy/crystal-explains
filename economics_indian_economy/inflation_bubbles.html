                <h2>Inflation</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>
                  Inflation is defined as a sustained increase in the general
                  level of prices for goods and services. With inflation, the
                  <b>purchasing power</b> of the currency falls. In other words,
                  a unit rupee will get the consumer less goods and services
                  after inflation, than it did previously.
                </p>
                <h3>Measuring Inflation</h3>
                <p>
                  Inflation is measured by tracking the change in purchasing
                  power of a currency. For this purpose Economists pick a basket
                  of commonly used goods and services (like food and fuel). This
                  is called
                  <b>Consumer/Market Basket</b>. They add up the price of this
                  year's basket, and do the same thing next year, and the year
                  after that. So eventually you have a long list of basket costs
                  for a bunch of different years.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Then, they pick a base year (2011-12 in case of India) and
                  divide the basket cost of each year, by the basket cost in the
                  base year and multiply it times 100. That gives you something
                  called the
                  <b>consumer price index</b>. The CPI shows how prices have
                  changed between different years, and it's by far the most
                  commonly used measure of inflation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Economists can use the Consumer Price Index to calculate the
                  rate of inflation, how quickly the price level is rising from
                  year to year.
                </p>
                <div class="note">
                  CPI = Cost of Market Basket in given year/ Cost of Market
                  Basket in base year * 100

                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    India uses another indicator called Wholesale Price Index
                    (WPI) to measure the price changes in the wholesale market.
                    WPI calculates the price paid by the manufacturers and
                    wholesalers in the sale of goods in <b>bulk quantity</b> in
                    the market. It is not as popular as CPI in other countries.

                <h3>Adjusting Inflations - Real and Nominal Price</h3>
                <p>
                  We all know that prices tend to go up over time. Assume that
                  we need to find the Highest Grossing Indian Movie of all time.
                  It's not quite right to compare the box office revenue earned
                  by films like Sholay(1975) or Mughal-e-Azam(1960) with the
                  recent box office toppers like Dangal or Bahubali. The average
                  movie ticket in the India in 1960s and 1970s was below 1
                  rupee. Today, it is above 100 Rupees. So, to compare box
                  office sales between different years, we have to adjust for
                  inflation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Sholay, Mughal-e-Azam, Dangal and Bahubali were all made in
                  different years, with different ticket prices. The CPI allows
                  us to adjust for inflation by leveling the playing field and
                  putting all the earnings in the same base year prices. You'll
                  hear economists using the words "nominal" and "real" a lot.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Real" means that a price from the past has been adjusted for
                  inflation. "Nominal" means a price from the past that hasn't
                  been adjusted for inflation. When economists make historical
                  comparisons, they always use "real" values.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It's worth noting that the CPI isn't perfect. Since we have to
                  keep the market basket constant over time, a traditional CPI
                  won't adjust for either new products or increases in product
                  quality. So, a market basket from the 1950s might include a
                  black and white TV that gets a few channels and weighs a ton.
                  It's nothing like your 45-inch flat screen.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Government economists use adjustment factors to simultaneously
                  account for technological progress and keep two different
                  years comparable. But, it's very complicated and not necessary
                  at this stage.
                </p>

                    The Inflation Argument: Good vs Bad
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    A moderate amount of price rise is usually considered good
                    for the economy. That is because increased prices encourage
                    producers to produce more, thus leading to increased growth
                    and increased purchasing power for the average consumer.
                    Thus, while the price has risen so has the purchasing power
                    of individual. So, the economy has grown, but individual
                    consumer is just as good if not better off. In the
                    long-term, this will translate to more product refinement,
                    greater quality, etc.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, when the rate of inflation is higher than the
                    increase in income levels for all sections or for a
                    particular section of society, then inflation becomes
                    terribly bad. Consider for instance that the price of most
                    commodities has gone up by about 10%; but the income levels
                    of the bottom 50% of the populace hasn’t grown up at all,
                    but that of the top 50% has risen by 20%. The poorer
                    sections of the society will be overburdened by the
                    price-rise. Also consider individuals with fixed incomes
                    such as pensioners and old people living off interest on
                    their earnings, such individuals are also hit very hard.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the short-term, high growth and high inflation can
                    co-exist. However, in the long-run inflation will dampen out
                    growth.

                <p>
                  There are two major types of inflation based on the nature of

                  <b>Demand-Pull Inflation:</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  A mismatch between demand and supply pulls up prices. Either
                  the demand increases over the same level of supply, or the
                  supply decreases with the same level of demand and thus the
                  situation of demand-pull inflation arise. It is a scenario
                  where
                  <b>too much money in the market chasing too few goods</b>.
                  This was a Keynesian idea.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Keynesian School suggests cuts in spending as the way of
                  tackling excess demand mainly by increasing taxes and reducing
                  government expenditure. In practice, the governments keep
                  tracking the demand-supply matrix to check such inflation.
                  Depending upon the situation, the goods in short supply are
                  imported, interest on loans increased and wages revised.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b> Cost Push Inflation </b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  An increase in factor input costs (i.e., wages and raw
                  materials) pushes up prices. The price rise which is the
                  result of increase in the production cost is cost-push
                  inflation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Keynesian school suggested controls on prices and incomes
                  as direct ways of checking such an inflation and, ‘moral
                  suasions’ and measures to reduce the monopoly as indirect
                  measures. Today, the governments of the world use many tools
                  to check such inflations—reducing excise and custom duties on
                  raw materials, wage revisions, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So, to keep it simple, inflation is caused by either consumer
                  bidding up the prices of stuff, or producers rising prices and
                  producing less, because there's an increase in production
                  cost. Either way, inflation is the result of having more money
                  than goods and services.

                <p><b>Hyper Inflation</b>:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    It is an inflation, which is large and accelerating, which
                    might have annual rates in millions. In such case, not only
                    the increase is very large, but it takes place in a very
                    short span of time. One definition of hyperinflation is when
                    a country experiences a monthly inflation rate of over 50%
                    or around 13,000% annual inflation.

                    For instance, Germany, after World War I, experienced such
                    inflation. Zimbabwe experienced Hyperinflation between 2007
                    and 2009. The root of the problem in both Weimar Germany and
                    Zimbabwe was that the government was paying their bills by
                    printing new money. An increase in the money supply can have
                    two effects. It can increase output or increase prices or
                    some combination of the two. Inflation starts when output is
                    pushed to capacity and can't rise much further, but policy
                    makers continue to increase the money supply.

                    Venezuela is experiencing it right now that began in 2016.
                    In the 1950s, 60s and 70s, Venezuela had one of the
                    strongest economies in Latin America with stable
                    inflation.Economic mis-management and political instability
                    have reduced oil exports from Venezuela. The government's
                    tried to keep the economy growing by printing more money,
                    but that's only resulted in falling purchasing power of
                    currency and soaring prices.

                <h3>Measures to Control Inflation</h3>
                <p>
                  <b>Monetary Measures</b>: They aim at reducing aim at reducing
                  money supply.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <b>Credit Control:</b> One of the important monetary
                    measures is <b>monetary policy</b>. The Central Bank of the
                    country adopts a number of methods to control the quantity
                    and quality of credit. For this purpose, it raises the bank
                    rates, sells securities in the open market, raises the
                    reserve ratio and adopts a number of selective credit
                    control measures, such as raising margin requirements and
                    regulating consumer credit. Monetary policy may not be
                    effective in controlling inflation, if inflation is due to
                    cost-push factors. Monetary policy can only be helpful in
                    controlling inflation due to demand-pull factors.

                  <li>
                    <b>Demonetization of Currency:</b> One of the monetary
                    measures is to demonetize currency of higher denominations.
                    Such a measure is usually adopted when there is abundance of
                    black money in the country.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Issue of New Currency: </b> The most extreme monetary
                    measure is the issue of new currency in place of the old
                    currency. Under this system, one new note is exchanged for a
                    number of notes of the old currency. The value of bank
                    deposits is also fixed accordingly. Such a measure is
                    adopted when there is an excessive issue of notes and there
                    is hyperinflation in the country. It is a very effective
                    measure but is inequitable because it hurts the small
                    depositors the most.

                </ul>
                <p>
                  <b>Fiscal Measures: </b>Monetary policy alone is incapable of
                  controlling inflation. It should, therefore, be supplemented
                  by fiscal measures. The principal fiscal measures are the
                  following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <b>Reduction in Unnecessary Expenditure:</b> The government
                    should reduce unnecessary expenditure on non-development
                    activities in order to curb inflation. This will also put a
                    check on private expenditure which is dependent upon
                    government demand for goods and services. But it is not easy
                    to cut government expenditure. Though this measure is always
                    welcome, but it becomes difficult to distinguish between
                    essential and non-essential expenditure. Therefore, this
                    measure should be supplemented by taxation.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b> Increase in Taxes: </b> To cut personal consumption
                    expenditure, the rates of personal, corporate and commodity
                    taxes should be raised and even new taxes should be levied,
                    but the rates of taxes should not be so high as to
                    discourage saving, investment and production. Rather, the
                    tax system should provide large incentives to those who
                    save, invest and produce more. Further, to bring more
                    revenue into the tax-net, the government should penalize the
                    tax evaders by imposing heavy fines. Such measures are bound
                    to be effective in controlling inflation. To increase the
                    supply of goods within the country, the government should
                    reduce import duties and increase export duties.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Surplus Budgets:</b> An important measure is to adopt
                    anti-inflationary budgetary policy. For this purpose, the
                    government should give up deficit financing and instead have
                    surplus budgets. It means collecting more in revenues and
                    spending less.

                <h2>Bubbles</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>
                  Prices go up all the time without necessarily causing
                  inflation. Let's look at the prices of chocolate over the past
                  few months. and the price of housing ten years ago.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the case of chocolate, we have a straight forward supply
                  and demand story. As nations develop, their consumers are
                  spending more on treats, like chocolate. Also, dark chocolate
                  has become more popular world-wide. Now both of these trends
                  have increased demands for the coca beans, which is used to
                  produce chocolate. Now at the same time, disease and drought
                  have limited harvests and decreased supply. Higher demand and
                  lower supply mean higher prices for chocolate.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On the other hand, it's hard to explain the rise in home
                  prices with just supply and demand. The population didn't
                  suddenly skyrocket or get that much richer, and it's not like
                  there was a shortage in building materials.

                <h3>Financial Crisis of 2008</h3>
                <p>
                  Between 2001 and 2008, home prices in western economies
                  diverged from these fundamentals, in what economists call
                  <b>"a bubble."</b> Rapid increases, driven by irrational
                  decisions. In the early 2000s, low interest rates and
                  deceitful lending practices encouraged more people to buy
                  homes. That raised demand and increased the price.
                </p>
                <p>
                  People saw prices increase and assumed it would continue
                  forever. So, they bought houses in hopes of making a huge
                  profit. This is called <b>speculation</b>. More buyers are
                  pulled into the market and prices rose faster and faster. In
                  fact, average home prices in the U.S. doubled between 2000 and
                  2006, and nearly tripled in cities like Los Angeles and Las
                  Vegas.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There were even more dramatic spikes in home prices in
                  countries like Ireland and Spain. News stories about rising
                  real estate prices, along with easy credit, convinced even
                  more people that buying a home was a one-way ticket to riches.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Eventually, some institutions even started using what are
                  called <b>predatory lending</b> practices to generate
                  mortgages. They made loans without verifying income and
                  offered absurd, adjustable rate mortgages with payments people
                  could afford, at first, but quickly ballooned beyond their
                  means.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At the time, there were plenty of people pointing out that
                  rising home prices were unsustainable. In fact, in 2005 the
                  Economist magazine called the global rise in home prices the
                  biggest bubble in history. And economists were predicting a
                  crash.

                  The problem with a bubble is that depends on an
                  ever-increasing supply of buyers with each person betting that
                  they'll be able to sell at a higher price to the next person.
                  But eventually, you run out of buyers and the bubble bursts.

                  The stock market crashed in 2008 and the U.S. economy suddenly
                  found itself in a disastrous situation with people unable to
                  pay their mortgages. The Federal Reserve stepped in and
                  offered to make emergency loans to banks (called bank
                  bailout).

                  In the end, the thing to remember about this massive systemic
                  failure, is that it happened in a system made up of humans,
                  with human failing. Some didn't understand what was happening.
                  Some willfully ignored the problems. And some were simply
                  unethical, motivated by the massive amounts of money involved.

                <h3>Other Bubbles in History</h3>
                <p>
                  Bubbles aren't a new thing. In the late 1990s there was a
                  stock market bubble for companies involved in this brand-new
                  computer thingy, called the internet. Investors poured
                  billions of dollars into internet stocks. The stock market
                  collapsed in early 2000 (referred to as dot-com bubble).

                  Perhaps the granddaddy of all bubbles was Dutch tulip mania in
                  the 1630s. Tulip gardens became a social fad among the
                  emerging class of wealthy merchants, driving up their price.
                  More and more people got in on the tulip action, making quick
                  fortunes. And that brought in even more people, desperate to
                  get their hands on a tulip bulb. At the height of the mania,
                  people were willing to exchange twelve acres of land, or ten
                  years worth of salary for a single tulip bulb. The bubble
                  burst and tulip bulbs are now less than a dollar.

                  If we imagine the economy as a car, then GDP, employment and
                  inflation are the gauges. A car can cruise along at 65 km per
                  hour without overheating. Safe cruising speed is like full
                  employment; unemployment is low, prices are stable and people
                  are happy.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But if we drive that car too fast for too long, it'll
                  overheat, and in the economy, significant spending increases
                  GDP causing an <b>expansion</b>. Unemployment falls and
                  factories start producing at full capacity to keep up with
                  demand. Since the number of products that can be produced is
                  limited, people start to outbid each other, resulting in
                  inflation. Eventually, production costs increase as workers
                  demand higher wages and the economy starts to slow down.
                  Businesses lay off a few workers. This is a
                  <b>contraction</b>; the economy is going to slow. Eventually
                  things stabilize, production costs fall since resources are
                  sitting idle, and the economy starts to expand again. This
                  process of booms and busts is called the
                  <b>business cycle</b>.
