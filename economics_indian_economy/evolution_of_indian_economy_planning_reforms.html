                  Evolution of Indian Economy: Planning and Reforms
                </h1>
                <h2>Under British Rule</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>
                  An understanding of the economy before independence is
                  necessary to know and appreciate the level of development
                  achieved during the post-independence period.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Under the colonial dispensation, the economic policies of the
                  government were concerned more with the protection and
                  promotion of British economic interests than with the need to
                  develop the economic condition of the Indian Subcontinent and
                  its people. The British Empire with their deliberate policies
                  transformed India into a supplier of raw material and consumer
                  of manufactured goods. The period famously known as Industrial
                  Revolution in world history became the reason for
                  de-industrialization in Indian history
                </p>
                <p>
                  The agricultural sector continued to experience stagnation and
                  incremental deterioration despite the fact that the largest
                  section of Indian population depended on it for sustenance.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Systematic policies pursued by the British-India government
                  led to the collapse of Indiaâ€™s world famous handicraft
                  industries without contributing, in any significant manner, to
                  its replacement by a modern industrial base.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Lack of adequate public health facilities, occurrence of
                  frequent natural calamities and famines pauperised the hapless
                  Indian people and resulted in engendering high mortality
                  rates.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Some efforts were made by the colonial regime to improve
                  infrastructure facilities like roads and railways but these
                  efforts were spiced with selfish motives though, in the long
                  run, the independent Indian government built on this base the
                  countryâ€™s future economic and social development plan.
                </p>
                <h3>Indiaâ€™s Economy on the Eve of Independence</h3>

                <p>
                  India, at the time of Independence, showed all signs of what
                  today is called underdeveloped country. It was caught in a
                  vicious cycle of poverty characterized by one of the lowest
                  per capita consumption and income levels.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The capacity to save and invest for capital formation was very
                  low. The impact of modern industrialism reacted adversely on
                  the traditional patterns of economic life. This retrogression
                  led to a decline in productivity per person engaged in
                  agriculture and crafts. The result was a continuous increase
                  in underemployment and the growth of an attitude of
                  sympathetic contentment on the part of the people. In such an
                  environment, there could be little economic or social
                  progress.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On the whole, India as a nation was fighting with poverty,
                  hunger, illiteracy, disease and overall underdevelopment.
                </p>
                <h2>Indian Economy 1950-1990</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>
                  After independence, India envisaged an economic system which
                  combines the best features of socialism and capitalismâ€”this
                  culminated in the mixed economy model.
                </p>
                <p>
                  All the economic planning has been formulated through five
                  year plans. Common goals of five year plans are growth,
                  modernisation, self-sufficiency and equity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The major policy initiatives in agriculture sector were land
                  reforms and green revolution. These initiatives helped India
                  to become self-sufficient in food grains production.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Policy initiatives in the industrial sector raised its
                  contribution to GDP. One of the major drawbacks in the
                  industrial sector was the inefficient functioning of the
                  public sector as it started incurring losses leading to drain
                  on the nationâ€™s limited resources.
                </p>
                <div class="note">
                  <h3 style="text-align: center">License Raj</h3>
                  <p>
                    The need to obtain a license to start an industry was
                    misused by industrial houses; a big industrialist would get
                    a license not for starting a new firm but to prevent
                    competitors from starting new firms. The excessive
                    regulation of what came to be called the
                    <b>permit license raj</b>
                    prevented certain firms from becoming more efficient. More
                    time was spent by industrialists in trying to obtain a
                    license or lobby with the concerned ministries rather than
                    on thinking about how to improve their products.
                  </p>
                </div>
                <h3>Planning in India</h3>
                <p>
                  A number of efforts were made to formulate a plan of
                  Socio-Economic Development in the pre-independence era of 20th
                  century. The first blueprint of Indian planning was given by a
                  popular civil engineer and ex-Dewan of Mysore Sir M
                  Visvesvaraya in his books "The Planned Economy of India"
                  (1934). He believed that growth rate achieved by
                  industrialization will be more than that of agriculture. His
                  idea of state planning emphasized on industrialization, as he
                  proposed a shift from agriculture to industries and targeted
                  to double the national income in one decade.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <b> The Planning Commission: </b> The Planning Commission was
                  made on the recommendations of the National Planning
                  Committee's report of 1949, which stressed the need for
                  economic and social planning for the country as a whole. It
                  emerged as a permanent body of experts, which came into
                  existence on 15th March 1950 under the chairmanship of Pt.
                  Jawaharlal Nehru, through a Cabinet Resolution. Prime minister
                  was the ex-officio chairman of the commission. The Planning
                  Commission constitutes an extra - constitutional and
                  non-statutory body It was replaced by NITI Aayog in January 1,
                  2015.

                <p>
                  Five Year Plans are centralized and integrated national
                  economic programmes. Joseph Stalin implemented the first Five
                  Year Plan in the Soviet Union in the late 1920s. Most
                  communist states and several capitalist countries subsequently
                  have adopted them. China and India both continue to use Five
                  Year Plans, although China renamed its Eleventh Five Year
                  Plan, from 2006 to 2010, a guideline, rather than a plan, to
                  signify the Central Governmentâ€™s more hands-off approach to
                  development.

                  India 1st fiver year plan was between 1951 and 1956. The last
                  five year plan was the 12th Plan (2012-2017). With the
                  Planning Commission dissolved, no more five year plans are
                  made for the economy.

                <h2>Economic Reforms Since 1991</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>
                  After forty years of planned development, India has been able
                  to achieve a strong industrial base and became self-sufficient
                  in the production of food grains. Nevertheless, a major
                  segment of the population continues to depend on agriculture
                  for its livelihood. In 1991, a crisis in the
                  <b>balance of payments</b> led to the introduction of economic
                  reforms in the country. This unit is an appraisal of the
                  reform process and its implications for India.

                <div class="note">
                  <h3 style="text-align: center">Financial Crisis 1991</h3>
                  <p>
                    In 1991, India met with an economic crisis relating to its
                    external debt â€” the government was not able to make
                    repayments on its borrowings from abroad due to huge fiscal
                    deficit (country is spending more than it is earning).
                    <b>Foreign exchange reserves</b>, which we generally
                    maintain to import petrol and other important items, dropped
                    to levels that were not sufficient for even a fortnight. The
                    crisis was further compounded by rising prices of essential
                    goods.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The World Bank and IMF also stopped their assistance,
                    leaving the government with no option except to mortgage the
                    country's gold to avoid defaulting on payments.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The crisis, in turn, paved the way for the liberalisation of
                    the Indian economy, since one of the conditions stipulated
                    in the World Bank loan (structural reform), required India
                    to open itself up to participation from foreign entities in
                    its industries, including its state-owned enterprises.

                <h3>Reforms</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    In the domestic economy, major reforms were undertaken in
                    the industrial and financial sectors. Major external sector
                    reforms included foreign exchange deregulations and import
                    liberalisation.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    With a view to improving the performance of the public
                    sector, there was a consensus on reducing its role and
                    opening it up to the private sector. This was done through
                    <b>disinvestment</b> and <b>liberalisation</b> by putting an
                    end to License Raj.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Globalisation is the outcome of the policies of
                    liberalisation and privatisation. It means an integration of
                    the economy of the country with the world economy.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    India has kept its commitments towards liberalisation of
                    trade, made in the WTO, by removing quantitative
                    restrictions on imports and reducing tariff rates. The
                    objective of the WTO is to establish a rule based trade
                    regime to ensure optimum utilisation of world resources.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Impact</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <b>Outsourcing</b> is one of the important outcomes of the
                    globalisation process. In outsourcing, a company hires
                    regular service from external sources, mostly from other
                    countries. Outsourcing has intensified, in recent times,
                    because of the growth of fast modes of communication,
                    particularly the growth of Information Technology (IT).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    During the reforms, growth of agriculture and industry has
                    gone down but the service sector has registered growth.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    Reforms have not benefited the agriculture sector. There has
                    also been a decline in public investment in this sector.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Industrial sector growth has slowed down due to availability
                    of cheaper imports and lower investment.
