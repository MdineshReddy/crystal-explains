                <h1 class="title">RBI and the Monetary Policy</h1>
                <p>
                  Reserve Bank of India is the central bank of India. Europe has
                  the European Central Bank or ECB, US has the Federal Reserve
                  (commonly called "The Fed") and other countries have
                  institutions that play similar roles.
                </p>
                <p>Most central banks have two important jobs.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    First, they regulate and oversee the nation's commercial
                    banks by making sure that banks have enough money in their
                    reserve to avoid bank runs.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Their second job, and the job we're going to discuss in this
                    article, is to conduct monetary policy which is increasing
                    or decreasing the money supply to speed up or slow down the
                    overall economy.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Interest rates</h3>
                <p>
                  An interest rate is the price of borrowing money. When banks
                  lend money, they expect to be repaid the amount they lent,
                  which is called the principle, and a percentage of the
                  principle to cover inflation and to make some profit. That
                  percentage is called the interest rate.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The number of car loans, student loans, home loans, and
                  business loans that get made depends on interest rates. When
                  interest rates are low, borrowers will find it easier to pay
                  back loans so they will borrow more and spend more. When
                  interest rates are high, borrowers borrow less and therefore
                  spend less.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The RBI doesn't have the power to tell banks what interest
                  rate to charge customers. So instead, They manipulates
                  interest rates by changing the money supply.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If the RBI increases the money supply, there'll be plenty of
                  money for banks to loan out. Borrowers will shop around for
                  the best deal on a loan, and banks will be forced to lower
                  interest rates because they're going to have to compete or
                  else no one's going to borrow from them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A decrease in money supply has the opposite effect. Less money
                  supply means the banks have less money to loan out, so they're
                  going to try and get the highest interest rate possible. So,
                  less money - higher interest rates.
                </p>
                <h3>Types of Monetary Policy</h3>
                <p>
                  Monetary Policy is of two types: Expansionary Monetary Policy
                  and Contractionary Monetary Policy.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If the central bank wants to speed up the economy, they can
                  increase the money supply, which will decrease interest rates,
                  and lead to more borrowing and spending. That's called
                  <b>Expansionary Monetary Policy</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If the central bank wants to slow down the economy, they
                  decrease the money supply - less money available will increase
                  interest rates and decrease spending. That's called
                  <b>Contractionary Monetary Policy</b>.
                </p>
                <h2>But how does a central bank change the money supply?</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>
                  There are three main ways a central bank can change the money
                  supply.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b> By Changing the Reserve Requirement: </b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  When you deposit money in a bank, the bank holds a portion of
                  deposits and loans the rest out. This is called
                  <b>Fractional Reserve Banking</b>. The fraction deposits banks
                  are required to hold in reserves is called the
                  <b>Reserve Requirement</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The first way a central bank can change the money supply is by
                  changing that requirement. Decreasing the Reserve Requirement
                  will increase the money supply, and increasing the Reserve
                  Requirement decreases the money supply. The central bank is
                  the banker's bank, so if a commercial bank needs money, they
                  can borrow from the central bank.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b> By Changing the interest Rate: </b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The second thing the central bank can do to change the money
                  supply is to change the interest rate that it charges banks.
                  That interest rate is called the <b>Discount Rate</b>.
                  Decreasing the Discount Rate will make it easier for banks to
                  borrow, and that'll increase the money supply. Increasing that
                  rate will decrease the money supply.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b> Open Market Operations: </b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The third method is called Open Market Operations. This is
                  when central bank buys or sells short term government bonds. A
                  government bond, or something called a treasury bill, is an
                  IOU issued by the government that says, "I'll pay you back
                  later." Banks hold those bonds because they earn interest and
                  are generally less risky than stocks.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If the central bank buys these previously issued government
                  bonds from a bank, it increases that bank's liquidity and
                  increases the money supply. If the central bank issues more
                  bonds, the banks will have less liquidity and less money to
                  loan out, and that'll decrease the money supply.
                </p>
                <h2>Instruments of Monetary Policy</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>
                  RBI uses the following instruments to implement the monetary
                  policy:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Interest Rate Instruments include Repo Rate, Reverse Repo
                    Rate and Bank Rate.

                <h3>Repo Rate (or Repurchase rate)</h3>
                <p>
                  <b>Definition by RBI:</b> The (fixed) interest rate at which
                  the Reserve Bank provides overnight liquidity to banks against
                  the collateral of government and other approved securities
                  under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The rate of interest that RBI charges from banks on their
                  short-term borrowing is the repo rate in India. Basically,
                  this is an abbreviated form of the ‘rate of repurchase’ and in
                  western economies it is known as the ‘Discount Rate’. In
                  practice it is not called an interest rate but considered a
                  discount on the dated government securities, which are
                  deposited by institution to borrow for the short term. When
                  they get their securities released from the RBI, the value of
                  the securities is lost by the amount of the current repo rate.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Call Money Market of India (inter-bank market) operates at
                  this rate and banks use this route for overnight borrowings.
                  This rate has direct relation with the interest rates banks
                  charge on the loans they offer (as it affects the operational
                  cost of the banks). In October 2013, RBI introduced term repos
                  (of different tenors, such as, 7/14/28 days), to inject
                  liquidity over a period that is longer than overnight. It has
                  several purposes to serve—stronger money market, stability,
                  and better costing and signaling of the loan products.
                </p>
                <h3>Reverse Repo Rate</h3>
                <p>
                  <b>Definition by RBI:</b> The (fixed) interest rate at which
                  the Reserve Bank absorbs liquidity, on an overnight basis,
                  from banks against the collateral of eligible government
                  securities under the Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF).
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is the rate of interest the RBI pays to its clients who
                  offer short-term loan to it. It is reverse of the repo rate
                  and this was started in 1996 as part of Liquidity Adjustment
                  Facility (LAF) by the RBI. In practice, financial institutions
                  operating in India park their surplus funds with the RBI for
                  short-term period and earn money. It has a direct bearing on
                  the interest rates charged by the banks and the financial
                  institutions on their different forms of loans.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This tool was utilized by the RBI in the wake of over money
                  supply with the Indian banks and lower loan disbursal to serve
                  twin purposes of cutting down banks losses and the prevailing
                  interest rate.

                    Liquidity Adjustment Facility
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    A liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) is a tool used in
                    monetary policy, primarily by the RBI that allows banks to
                    borrow money through repurchase agreements (repos) or to
                    make loans to the RBI through reverse repo agreements. This
                    arrangement is effective in managing liquidity pressures and
                    assuring basic stability in the financial markets. The use
                    of LAF is done through repo transactions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <b> Example </b>
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Let’s assume a bank has a short-term cash shortage due to
                      a recession gripping the Indian economy. The bank would
                      use the RBI's liquidity adjustment facility by executing a
                      repo agreement by selling government securities to the RBI
                      in return for a loan with an agreement to repurchase those
                      securities back. For example, say the bank needs a one-day
                      loan for 50,000,000 Indian rupees and executes a repo
                      agreement at 6.25%. The bank's payable interest on the
                      loan is ₹8,561.64 (₹50,000,000 x 6.25% / 365).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Now let’s suppose the economy is expanding and a bank has
                      excess cash on hand. In this case, the bank would execute
                      a reverse repo agreement by making a loan to the RBI in
                      exchange for government securities, in which RBI agrees to
                      repurchase those securities. For example, the bank may
                      have ₹25,000,000 available to loan the RBI and decides to
                      execute a one-day reverse repo agreement at 6%. The bank
                      would receive ₹4109.59 in interest from the RBI
                      (₹25,000,000 x 6% / 365).
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </div>

                <h3>Bank Rate</h3>
                <p>
                  The interest rate which the RBI charges on its
                  <b>long-term lendings</b> (loans) is known as the Bank Rate.
                  The clients who borrow through this route are the Government
                  of India, state governments, banks, financial institutions,
                  co-operative banks, NBFCs, etc. This rate has been aligned to
                  the Marginal Standing Facility (MSF) rate and, therefore,
                  changes automatically as and when the MSF rate changes.

                <h3>Open Market Operations (OMOs)</h3>
                <p>
                  These include both, outright purchase and sale of government
                  securities, for injection and absorption of durable liquidity,
                  respectively.
                </p>
                <h3>Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR)</h3>
                <p>
                  RBI mandates that banks store a proportion of their deposits
                  in the <b>form of cash</b> so that the same can be given to
                  the bank’s customers if the need arises. The percentage of
                  cash required to be kept in reserves, vis-a-vis a bank’s total
                  deposits, is called the Cash Reserve Ratio. The cash reserve
                  is either stored in the bank’s vault or is sent to the RBI.
                  Banks do not get any interest on the money that is with the
                  RBI under the CRR requirements.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If the current CRR rate is 4%, a bank is required to store 4%
                  of the total NDTL or the Net Demand and Time Liabilities in t
                  he form of cash. The bank cannot use this money for investment
                  or lending.
                </p>
                <p><b> Objectives of Cash Reserve Ratio </b></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Since a part of the bank’s deposits is with the RBI, it
                    ensures the security of the amount. It makes it readily
                    available when customers want their deposits back. Hence CRR
                    is primarily used to make sure that banks are not vulnerable
                    to bank runs.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Also, CRR helps in keeping inflation under control. At the
                    time of high inflation in the economy, RBI increases the
                    CRR, so that banks need to keep more money in reserves so
                    that they have less money to lend further.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR)</h3>
                <p>
                  Under it, all scheduled commercial banks operating in the
                  country are supposed to maintain a part of their total
                  deposits (i. e., their NDTL) <b>with themselves</b> in either
                  <b>cash or non-cash form</b>
                  — such as, government securities, RBI approved corporate
                  bonds, cash and gold. Banks earn income on this investment as
                  per the configuration of their investments in the G-Secs.
                </p>
                <div class="note">
                  <b>CRR versus SLR:</b> Unlike SLR, which can be maintained in
                  either gold or cash, CRR needs to be maintained only in cash.
                  CRR regulates the flow of money in the economy whereas SLR
                  ensures the solvency of the banks.

                    Liquidity Ratio (SLR) portfolio up to a limit at a penal
                    rate of interest. This provides a safety valve against
