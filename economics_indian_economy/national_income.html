                <h1 class="title">National Income</h1>
                <p>
                  National income is the value of goods and services produced by
                  a country during a financial year. For India, this financial
                  year is from 1st April to 31st March. The progress of a
                  country can be determined by the growth of the national income
                  of the country.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Measuring progress has been a major riddle for experts. Income
                  as an indicator of progress was tried by many before the idea
                  of the gross domestic product (GDP) was put forward by the
                  US-economist Simon Kuznets in 1934. The method tries to
                  calculate a country’s income at domestic and national
                  levels—in gross and net forms—having four clear concepts: GDP,
                  NDP, GNP and NNP.
                </p>
                <p>
                  (Note: If you are new to economics, we don't expect you to
                  grasp each concept of this article right away, since this
                  topic touches upon almost every other topic in economics (like
                  inflation, taxation, subsidies, etc). Don't worry, return to
                  this topic once you finish others, so that you can have a
                  better understanding.)

                <h3>Gross Domestic Product (GDP)</h3>

                <p>
                  GDP is the value of all final goods and services produced
                  <b>within</b> a country's border during a financial year. Lets
                  understand this concept by understanding its terms, ‘gross’
                  means ‘total’; ‘domestic’ means all economic activities done
                  within the boundary of a nation/country and by its own
                  capital; ‘product’ is used to define ‘goods and services’
                  together; and ‘final’ means the stage of a product after which
                  there is no known chance of value addition in it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  An economy has four components that make up GDP. Each
                  represents a different group that can purchase things in the
                  economy. They are
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>consumer spending,</li>
                  <li>business spending which is called investment,</li>
                  <li>government spending, and</li>
                  <li>
                    net exports which is basically spending by other countries.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  GDP can be calculated in three ways, using expenditures,
                  production, or incomes. It can be adjusted for inflation (Real
                  GDP) and population to provide deeper insights.
                </p>

                  <li>
                    <b>The Expenditure (Spending) Approach</b>: calculates
                    spending by the different groups that participate in the
                    economy. This approach can be calculated using the following
                    formula:
                  </li>
                  <div class="note">
                    <p style="text-align: center">GDP = C + G + I + (X-M)</p>
                    <p>
                      (where C = Consumption; G = Government spending; I = Gross
                      Investment; and (X-M) = net exports i.e.,
                      exports-imports). All these activities contribute to the
                      GDP of a country. In a closed economy GDP = C+G+I, since
                      net exports = 0.
                    </p>
                  </div>
                  <li>
                    <b>The Production (Output) Approach:</b> The production
                    approach is essentially the reverse of the expenditure
                    approach. Instead of measuring the input costs that
                    contribute to economic activity, the production approach
                    estimates the total value of economic output and deducts the
                    cost of intermediate goods that are consumed in the process
                    (like those of materials and services). Whereas the
                    expenditure approach projects forward from costs, the
                    production approach looks backward from the vantage point of
                    a state of completed economic activity.

                  <li>
                    <b>The Income Approach</b> The income approach represents a
                    kind of middle ground between the two other approaches to
                    calculating GDP. The income approach calculates the income
                    earned by all the factors of production in an economy,
                    including the wages paid to labor, the rent earned by land,
                    the return on capital in the form of interest, and corporate
                    profits.

                  <li>
                    It refers to the total value of all the goods and services
                    <b>at market price</b> produced during a year within a
                    country's border.

                  <li>
                    Market price refers to the actual transacted price and it
                    includes indirect taxes such as Excise Duty, VAT (Value
                    Added Tax), Service Tax, Customs Duty etc. but it excludes
                    government subsidies.

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    GDP can be calculated at factor cost. This measure more
                    accurately reveals the income paid to factors of production.

                  <li>
                    The factor cost means the total cost of all factors of
                    production consumed or used in producing a good or service.
                    It includes government grants or subsidies, but it excludes
                    Indirect Taxes.

                    The difference between Market Price (MP) and Cost Price (CP)

                <p><b>Nominal GDP and Real GDP</b></p>
                <p>
                  Nominal GDP is the GDP not adjusted for inflation. Real GDP is
                  the GDP adjusted for inflation. Just what "adjusted for
                  inflation" means is really important, but too big of a topic
                  to discuss right now. We'll get to it in this
                  <a href='/economics_indian_economy/inflation_bubbles.html'>article</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Real GDP is a better measurement of GDP, since it reflects the
                  increase in quantity of goods and services by adjusting for
                  any increase in prices. Real GDP is generally measured by
                  using base year prices of goods and services. India uses
                  2011-2012 as base year.

                <p>
                  <b>Example:</b> Consider two countries produce the same number
                  of cars, but one has higher prices, then that country's going
                  to have a higher nominal GDP, or GDP not adjusted for
                  inflation. To get a more accurate idea of the health of the
                  economy, economists look at Real GDP, which is GDP adjusted
                  for inflation.

                <h3>Net Domestic Product (NDP)</h3>
                <p>
                  Net Domestic Product (NDP) is the GDP calculated after
                  adjusting the weight of the value of ‘depreciation’. Every
                  asset go for depreciation in the process of their uses, which
                  means they ‘wear and tear’.
                </p>
                <div class="note">
                  <p style="text-align: center">NDP = GDP – Depreciation</p>
                </div>
                <p>
                  NDP is used for domestic use only, to show the achievements of
                  the economy in the area of research and development, which
                  have tried cutting the levels of depreciation in a historical
                  time period.
                </p>
                <h3>Gross National Product (GNP)</h3>
                <p>
                  GNP is the GDP of a country added with its ‘net income from
                  abroad’. Here, the trans-boundary economic activities of an
                  economy are also taken into account. The items which are
                  counted in the segment ‘net Income from Abroad’ are Private
                  Remittances, Interest on External Loans and External Grants.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The normal formula is GNP = GDP + Net Income from Abroad. Net
                  Income from abroad is given by subtracting payment to abroad
                  from income recieved from abroad.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In case of India GDP is always greater than GNP, since outflow
                  of money is more than inflow of money.
                </p>

                    GNP = C + G + I + (X - M) + (R - P)

                  <p>
                    (where C = Consumption; G = Government spending; I = Gross
                    Investment; (X-M) = net exports; (R-P) is income recieved
                    from abroad - payment outflow to abroad.)
                  </p>
                </div>
                <h3>Net National Product (NNP)</h3>
                <p>
                  Net National Product (NNP) of an economy is the GNP after
                  deducting the loss due to ‘depreciation’. The formula to
                  derive it may be written like:
                </p>
                <div class="note">
                  <p style="text-align: center">NNP = GNP – Depreciation</p>
                </div>
                <p>
                  This is the ‘National Income’ (NI) of an economy. Though, the
                  GDP, NDP and GNP, all are ‘national income’ they are not
                  written with capitalised ‘N’ and ‘I’. This is the purest form
                  of the income of a nation.
                </p>
                <div class="note">
                  <p style="text-align: center">
                    National Income (NI) = NNP - Indirect taxes + Subsidies.
                  </p>
                  <p style="text-align: center">
                    National Income (NI) = C + G + I + (X - M) + (R - P) -
                    Depreciation - Indirect taxes + Subsidies.

                <h2>Percapita Income</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>
                  When we divide NNP by the total population of a nation we get
                  the ‘per capita income’ (PCI) of that nation, i.e., ‘income
                  per head per year’.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A very basic point should be noted here that this is the point
                  where the rates of depreciation followed by different nations
                  make a difference. Higher the rates of depre-ciation lower the
                  PCI of the nation (whatever be the reason for it logical or
                  artificial as in the case of depreciation being used as a tool
                  of policymaking).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Though, economies are free to fix any rate of depreciation for
                  different assets, the rates fixed by them make difference when
                  the NI of the nations are compared by the international
                  financial institutions like the IMF, WB, ADB, etc.
