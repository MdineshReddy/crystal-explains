              <h1 class="title">Russian Revolution</h1>
              <p>
                The Russian Revolution of 1917 was one of the most significant
                political and social revolution commencing with the abolition of
                the monarchy in 1917 and concluding in 1923 with the Bolshevik
                establishment of the Soviet Union at the end of the Civil War.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Russian Revolution of 1905 was a major factor contributing
                to the cause of the Revolutions of 1917. Lenin, as later head of
                the USSR, called it <b>"The Great Dress Rehearsal"</b>, without
                which the "victory of the October Revolution in 1917 would have
                been impossible".
              </p>
              <h2>Background</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                Russia, in the 19th century was underdeveloped and a backwards
                society compared to the rest of the Europe. Besides the
                territory around Moscow, the Russian empire included current-day
                Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia,
                Armenia, Azerbaijan and Central Asian states (Kazakhstan,
                Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan).
              </p>
              <p>
                The Russian Empire practiced <b>serfdom</b>—a form of feudalism
                (which was by then ended in other european nations) in which
                landless peasants were forced to serve the land-owning nobility.
                While the serfs were breaking their backs in the fields, the
                Tsars held all the power.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 1861, the Russian Emperor Tsar Alexander II of the
                <b>Romanov dynasty</b> also known as
                <b> Alexander the Liberator</b> finally abolished serfdom. But
                the life of a peasant did not improve much. They resented paying
                redemption payments to the state, and demanded communal tender
                of the land they worked.
              </p>
              <p>
                Alexander II was followed by his son Alexander III as the new
                Tsar in 1881. He was highly reactionary and reversed some of the
                liberal reforms of his father. If Alexander II was the great
                reformer, Alexander III was the great repressor.
              </p>
              <p>
                Alexander III was followed by his son <b>Nicholas II</b> as the
                new Tsar in 1894. He was neither a reformer nor a repressor. He
                was a timid and easily swayed ruler.
              </p>
              <h3>Russian Revolution of 1905</h3>
              <p>
                At the beginning of the twentieth century, the vast majority of
                Russia’s population were agriculturists. <b>Sergei Witte</b>,
                One of the Tsar Nicholas II's most influential advisors and
                first 'Prime Minister' of Russian Empire, knew that Russia
                needed to catch up with the rest of Europe. Based on his
                Suggestions, the Nicholas borrowed some money and started
                industialization by setting up factories at
                <b>St Petersburg</b> (then capital) and <b>Moscow</b>.
              </p>
              <p>
                But the workers were subjected to poor working conditions - Long
                hours, low wages, filthy and disease-ridden factories, sleep in
                over crowded dormitories. So the workers started to protest and
                strike.
              </p>
              <p>
                During this period Russia went to war with Japan (1904-1905)
                over rival imperial ambitions in Manchuria and Korea. Seeing
                Russia as a rival, Japan offered to recognize Russian dominance
                in Manchuria in exchange for recognition of Korea being within
                the Japanese sphere of influence. Russia refused and demanded
                the establishment of a neutral buffer zone between Russia and
                Japan in Korea. Negotiations broke down and the war started in
                1904. The war ended with a humiliating defeat to the Russia in
                1905.
              </p>
              <p>
                The people of Russia were outraged with russia's defeat, Workers
                continued their strikes for better working conditions, Peasants
                were uprising for land rights, liberals were asking for reforms
                in administration and the military mutinies continued. The
                tension was rising rapidly and Russia was on the verge of
                revolution. All it needed was one disaster to push it over the
                edge.
              </p>
              <p>
                And that disaster would come on 22nd January, 1905. An Orthodox
                priest named Father Gapon was leading workers and their families
                to the winter palace (at St. Petersburg) in a peaceful protest.
                They wanted to deliver a petition to Nicholas which simply asked
                for more freedom and better working conditions. But the Imperial
                Soldiers opened fire on the crowd. Nicholas was not at the
                winter palace at that time.
              </p>
              <p>
                Hundreds died and Hundreds wounded. The event became known as
                <b>Bloody Sunday</b> and Nicholas's reputation plummeted.
                Strikes erupted across the empire, workers demands increased,
                liberals demanded political power, peasants demanded land. The
                country was out of control and the 1905 revolution had begun.
              </p>
              <p>
                But there was no unity among different parts of the society and
                people weren't working together. Meaning there was a weakness to
                exploit. Sergei wrote a manifesto that would give the liberals
                an elected assembly called the <b>Duma</b>. Nicholas agreed to
                share power and have his laws approved by an elected assembly.
              </p>
              <p>
                With the liberal satisfied and war with Japan ended, Nicholas
                ordered thousands of troops back home who then dismantled the
                remaining protestors, arrested their leaders and crushed the
                peasant uprisings in the countryside and the revolution of 1905
                died out.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 1906, Nicholas issued the Fundamental Laws, which gave him
                the title of "supreme autocrat". Although no law could be made
                without the Duma's assent, neither could the Duma pass laws
                without the approval of the noble-dominated State Council (half
                of which was to be appointed directly by the Tsar), and the Tsar
                himself retained a veto. Furthermore, the Tsar had the power to
                dismiss the Duma and announce new elections whenever he wished.
                All these powers and prerogatives assured that, in practice, the
                Government of Russia continued to be a
                <b>non-official absolute monarchy</b>.
              </p>
              <h2>Vladimir Lenin (1870-1924)</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                The rule of the Tsars was quickly becoming outdated and more
                Russians began wondering if there was a better way. For many,
                the solution was simple. Just look to the West, republics,
                democracies and constitutional monarchies galore.
              </p>
              <p>
                But a small growing group rejected that for an even better idea,
                <b>communism</b>. Prominent one among them was Vladimir Lenin,
                an intelligent member of Russia's middle-class.
              </p>
              <p>
                Lenin embraced revolutionary socialist politics from a young
                age. His older brother was executed for plotting to kill the
                Tsar and Lenin himself was expelled from university for
                participating in a student protest against the Tsarist
                government.
              </p>
              <p>
                His interest in Marxism was sparked by Karl Marx's writings,
                particularly,
                <b>The Communist Manifesto</b> and <b>Das Capital</b> . Lenin
                developed a variant of the communist ideology known as
                <b>Leninism</b> .
              </p>
              <div class="note">
                <p>
                  <b>Marxism</b> is a social, political, and economic philosophy
                  that examines the effect of capitalism on labor, productivity,
                  and economic development and argues for a worker revolution to
                  overturn capitalism in favor of communism. Marxism points that
                  the struggle between social classes—specifically between the
                  bourgeoisie, or capitalists, and the proletariat, or
                  workers—defines economic relations in a capitalist economy and
                  will inevitably lead to revolutionary communism.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Leninism:</b> is a political theory that proposes the
                  establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat
                  (working-class people) led by a revolutionary vanguard party,
                  as the political prelude to the establishment of communism.

                He moved to Saint Petersburg in 1893 and became a senior Marxist
                activist. In 1897, he was arrested for sedition and exiled to
                Siberia for three years, where he got married. After his exile,
                he moved to Western Europe, where he became a prominent theorist
                in the Marxist
                <b>Russian Social Democratic Labour Party</b> (RSDLP).
              </p>
              <p>
                In 1903, he took a key role in the RSDLP ideological split,
                leading the <b>Bolshevik</b> (russian for Majority) faction
                against <b>Mensheviks</b> (russian for Minority). The Mensheviks
                were less radical and were worried that Lenin's attitude could
                lead to a one-man dictatorship.
              </p>
              <p>
                With the outbreak of Russian Revolution of 1905, Lenin tried
                desperately to radicalize the uprising. Still in exile and
                lacking funds, the Bolsheviks simply weren't in a position to do
                anything. Around this time, Lenin met an Georgian revolutionary
                <b>Joseph Stalin</b> at a communist convention in Finland.
                Stalin raised funds for Vladimir Lenin's Bolshevik faction via
                robberies, kidnappings and protection rackets. Stalin was
                frequently exiled to Siberia.
              </p>
              <p>
                Till 1917, Lenin remained in Europe, writing his socialist
                newspaper and awaiting an opportunity to overthrow the Tsar and
                bring <b>communist utopia</b> to Russia.
              </p>
              <h2>Period between 1905 and 1917</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                After the 1905 revolution had failed, the Tsars new top man was
                <b>Pyotr Stolypin</b> who replaced Sergei Witte as the new Prime
                Minister. In order to prevent more chaos, he started
                agricultural reforms to please the Peasants and also cracked
                down hard on the Tsar's opponents.
              </p>
              <p>
                Many positive reforms were also being made and the Russian
                economy even began to improve. This is a problem for Lenin. If
                the people weren't suffering, then they wouldn't support a
                revolution.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Russian economy was making a recovery. For the Tsar, things
                were looking up. But the assosciation of the Tsar with a
                controversial and scandal ridden Mystic
                <b>Grigori Rasputin</b> helped discredit the tsarist government
                and became an important factor in the revolution of 1917.

                  Inspired by the humbled monks that wandered endlessly from
                  holy site to holy site, he spent years on pilgrimages across
                  Russia. On his travels, strangers were captivated by
                  Rasputin’s magnetic presence. Some even believed he had
                  mystical gifts of prediction and healing. Despite Rasputin’s
                  heavy drinking, petty theft, and promiscuity, his reputation
                  as a monk quickly spread beyond Siberia and attracted both
                  laypeople and powerful Orthodox clergymen.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When he finally reached the capital, St. Petersburg, Rasputin
                  used his charisma and connections to win favor as the imperial
                  family’s spiritual advisor.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In November 1905, Rasputin was finally introduced to Russian
                  Tsar Nicholas II. Nicholas and his wife Alexandra devoutly
                  believed in the Orthodox Church, as well as in mysticism and
                  supernatural powers, and this Siberian holy man had them
                  transfixed. It was a particularly tumultuous period for Russia
                  and their family. The monarchy was barely clinging to control
                  after the Revolution of 1905. Their political struggles were
                  only intensified by personal turmoil: Alexei, the heir to the
                  throne, had a life-threatening blood disease called
                  <b>hemophilia</b>. When Alexei suffered a severe medical
                  crisis in 1912, Rasputin advised his parents to reject
                  treatment from doctors. Alexei’s health improved, cementing
                  the royal family’s belief that Rasputin had magical healing
                  powers, and guaranteeing his privileged place on the royal
                  court.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Today, we know that the doctors had prescribed aspirin, a drug
                  that worsens hemophilia. After this incident, Rasputin made a
                  prophecy:
                  <b
                    >if he died, or the royal family deserted him, both their
                    son and their crown would soon be gone</b
                  >.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Outside the royal family, people had mixed views on Rasputin.
                  On one hand, peasants regarded him as one of their own,
                  amplifying their often-unheard voice to the monarchy. But
                  nobles and clergymen came to despise his presence. Rasputin
                  never ceased his scandalous behavior, and they were skeptical
                  of his so-called powers and thought he was corrupting the
                  royal family. They were convinced the only way to maintain
                  order was to eliminate him.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He was assassinated in december 1916. His death, like his life
                  was shrouded in mystery. But far from stabilizing the
                  monarchy’s authority, Rasputin’s death enraged the peasantry.
                  Just as Rasputin prophesied, his murder was swiftly followed
                  by that of the royal family. Whether the downfall of the
                  Russian monarchy was a product of the monk’s curse, or the
                  result of political tensions decades in the making, well, we
                  may never know.

              <h3>World War I and Russia</h3>
              <p>
                The outbreak of war in August 1914 initially served to quiet the
                prevalent social and political protests, focusing hostilities
                against a common external enemy, but this patriotic unity did
                not last long. As the war dragged on inconclusively,
                war-weariness gradually took its toll. Around this time the
                capital St. Petersburg was renamed to <b>Petrograd</b>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Nicholas had taken direct command of the army and left his
                ambitious but incapable wife Alexandra (who was a German) in
                charge of the government. Reports of corruption and incompetence
                in the Imperial government began to emerge, and the growing
                influence of Grigori Rasputin in the Imperial family was widely
                resented.
              </p>
              <p>
                An inefficient Tsarist government, meant there were shortages of
                just about everything you need to fight a war. Soldiers were
                deserting. The economy was imploding and in no time, Russia was
                starving. The peasants and the workers protests continued.
              </p>
              <h2>The February Revolution of 917</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                By 1917, Russia had been fighting a war it couldn't afford for
                three years. They were running out of many things, most
                worryingly, food. On International Women's Day, (March 8, 1917)
                , thousands of hungry women in Petrograd were so sick of being
                hungry that they took to the streets. Soon men joined too. The
                crowd demanded an end to the war, an end to food rationing and
                even an end to the Tsar autocracy. Even the soldiers joined the
                protest.
              </p>

              <p>
                Liberal politicians (members of Duma) had long been dissatisfied
                with the Tsar since he would shut their parliament down anytime
                they did something he didn't like. They convinced the generals
                (military chiefs) that if Nicholas abdicated, the people would
                calm down and the generals were onboard. And with the military
                no longer on his side, Nicholas had no choice but to step down.
                And so, 300 years of Romanov rule in Russia came to an end in
                March 1917. Nicholas was reunited with his family at the
                Alexander Palace at Tsarskoye Selo. He was placed under house
                arrest with his family by the Provisional Government.
              </p>

              <p>
                The immediate effect of the February Revolution was a widespread
                atmosphere of elation and excitement in Petrograd.
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  On 16 March, a <b>provisional government</b> was announced
                  which comprised the Liberals i.e., the members of Duma.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The socialists had formed their rival body, the
                  <b>Petrograd Soviet</b> (or workers' council) largely
                  controlled by Social Revolutionaries and the Mensheviks.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                The Petrograd Soviet and the Provisional Government competed for
                power over Russia, creating what in Soviet historiography is
                known as the
                <b>Dvoyevlastiye</b>
                (Dual power).
              </p>
              <h3>Lenin's Arrival</h3>

              <p>
                The provisional government did not drag Russia out of the war,
                the people were still hungry and the peasants were still hoping
                to get land rights. Meanwhile, the Soviets hadn't done much to
                change things either.
              </p>
              <p>
                With Germany's help Lenin returned to Petrograd in April and
                gave a speech to Bolshevik supporters condemning the Provisional
                Government and again calling for a continent-wide European
                proletarian revolution.
              </p>
              <p>
                He publicly condemned both the Mensheviks and the Social
                Revolutionaries, who dominated the influential Petrograd Soviet,
                for supporting the Provisional Government, denouncing them as
                traitors to socialism. He advocated immediate peace with Germany
                and Austria-Hungary, getting rid of the provisional government
                and the rule by soviets under his leadership.
              </p>
              <p>
                Lenin and Bolsheviks promised three things
                <b>"Peace, Food and Land"</b>. Bit by bit, the Bolsheviks became
                more popular. Some of the Mensheviks even sided with Bolsheviks,
                prominent among them is <b>Leon Trotsky.</b>
              </p>
              <p>
                The Minister of War of the Provisional Government,
                <b>Alexander Kerensky</b>, thought that if people saw more
                Russian victories, they'd have to support the new government.
                But the German troops won battle after battle against the
                Russians. These heavy defeats worsened the Russian economy and
                made the hungry people hungrier. Tens of thousands of armed
                workers took to the streets during some of the worst violence
                Petrograd had seen yet. And in response Kerensky called in the
                troops who opened fire on the demonstrators.
              </p>
              <p>
                For now, Lenin and other Bolshevik leaders wanted to distance
                themselves from the violence but the crowds marched under
                Bolshevik slogans and as a result, Kerensky now the prime
                minister took the opportunity to crack down hard on the
                Bolsheviks. Lenin fled to Finland under threat of arrest while
                Trotsky, among other prominent Bolsheviks, was arrested.
              </p>
              <p>
                In August, <b>General Kornilov</b> was appointed Supreme
                Commander of Russian military forces. Unfortunately for
                Kerensky, Kornilov hated the liberal and socialist reforms of
                the new government. Fearing a Bolshevik takeover was imminent,
                Kornilov ordered his men towards Petrograd to oust the soviet
                and take over.
              </p>
              <p>
                Desperate, Kerensky released Trotsky and other Bolshevik leaders
                and sought their help. He also sought help from the Petrograd
                Soviet, which called upon armed Red Guards to "defend the
                revolution". The Kornilov Affair failed largely due to the
                efforts of the Bolsheviks, whose influence over railroad and
                telegraph workers proved vital in stopping the movement of
                troops. With his coup failing, Kornilov surrendered and was
                relieved of his position. This whole affair was a huge
                propaganda win for the Bolsheviks. They had defended the
                revolution and their popularity skyrocketed.
              </p>
              <p>
                In early September, the Petrograd Soviet freed all jailed
                Bolsheviks and Trotsky became chairman of the Petrograd Soviet.
                They were now in a very powerful position, almost powerful
                enough for Lenin to return home from Finland and finally the
                stage was ready for the communist revolution.
              </p>

              <h2>October Revolution 1917</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                The Bolsheviks began planning their takeover of the Russian
                government. Lenin proposed an armed revolution while some
                members argued for a more peaceful approach. Kerensky began
                arresting Bolsheviks and as a result, they felt that they had no
                choice but to commence the revolution right away.
              </p>
              <p>
                Lenin was back in Petrograd but was still in hiding. So Trotsky
                using his position as Soviet Chairman organized the Bolshevik
                militias. In just one day, they took control of the city without
                much resistance. Kerensky managed to escape.
              </p>
              <p>
                Lenin came out of hiding to play a bigger role in the
                revolution. With him back at the helm, they stormed the Winter
                Palace and arrested the provisional government.
              </p>
              <p>
                Lenin was finally in charge of Russia. New elections were held
                (on 25 November 1917) to replace the newly dissolved provisional
                government. In the elections the Bolshevik party received 25% of
                the votes and the <b>Socialist-Revolutionaries</b> as much as
                58%. When it became clear that the Bolsheviks had little support
                outside of the industrialized areas of Saint Petersburg and
                Moscow, they simply barred non-Bolsheviks from membership in the
                Soviets and dissolved the Constituent Assembly in January 1918.
              </p>
              <p>
                For Lenin, setting up a communist utopia was looking
                suspiciously like setting up a dictatorship. While he was
                implementing many of the communists policies, he was also
                refusing to work with other political parties and cracking down
                on opposition.
              </p>
              <p>
                Outside russia, they were still at war with the Germans and they
                had promised to give the people peace. So Lenin made Trotsky
                Commissar for Foreign Affairs and sent him off to negotiate a
                peace deal with the Germans. The Germans offered Trotsky really
                harsh terms like giving up huge chunks of land. Trotsky proposed
                a <b>'No-War and No-Peace'</b> plan, where instead of appealing
                for peace, they simply do not take part in it.
              </p>
              <p>
                This plan proved disastrous, when the Germans saw the Russians
                had stopped fighting they slammed 700,000 troops deep into
                Russian territory with no resistance. Now the new peace treaty
                offered by Germans was way worse with Russia losing a huge
                amount of territory, population and resources.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Bolsheviks had no choice but to accept and Russia was
                humiliated and signed <b>Treaty of Brest-Litovsk</b> on 3 March
                1918. The treaty ceded vast territories, including Finland, the
                Baltic provinces, parts of Poland and Ukraine to the Central
                Powers. With Petrograd now in an exposed position, Lenin moved
                the capital to <b>Moscow</b>.
              </p>
              <h2>Civil War (1917-1923)</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                Things really weren't going well for Lenin and many, many people
                were extremely unhappy with the Bolshevik government and its
                actions. A variety of forces had united together to topple
                Lenin's government and Russia descended into a full blown civil
                war.
              </p>
              <p>
                The war was fought mainly between the <b>Red Army</b> ("Reds"),
                consisting of the Bolsheviks, and the <b>"Whites"</b>–
                socialists, liberals and supporters of autocracy who opposed the
                drastic restructuring championed by the Bolsheviks following the
                collapse of the Provisional Government, to the Soviets (under
                clear Bolshevik dominance). The whites were supported by the
                allied powers (Britain, France..).
              </p>
              <p>
                The Whites gained control of vast underdeveloped areas while the
                Bolshevik Reds controlled the industrial heartland using this to
                their advantage, along with the military genius of Trotsky and
                the disorganization of the White Army, the fortified Red Army
                gradually came out on top. It was an absolutely brutal conflict
                with both sides committing horrendous atrocities.
              </p>
              <p>
                To maintain order at home, the Bolsheviks began the
                <b>Red Terror</b>
                and the secret police would execute thousands of suspected
                traitors. No one was safe from the violence not even Nicholas
                himself.
              </p>
              <h3>Execution of the Romanov family</h3>
              <p>
                After his abdication, Nicholas and his family were placed under
                house arrest at the Alexander Palace at Tsarskoye Selo. At
                first, they were allowed to live in their usual luxury but after
                Lenin took over, their conditions worsened.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Bolsheviks feared that the White armies would free Nicholas
                and re-instate him as the Tsar. To stop this from happening,
                Nicholas's Bolshevik guards decided to act.
              </p>
              <p>
                It's not entirely certain whether Lenin ordered it or if the
                guards were acting on their own volition but on July 17th, 1918
                with White Armies approaching, they took Nicholas, his family
                and their servants down into the basement. There a squad of
                Bolsheviks murdered the entire family and their servants.
                Nicholas, the last Tsar, once one of the most powerful men alive
                had met a brutal end.

              <p>
                After years of fighting and millions of deaths, Trotsky and his
                Red Army came out victorious in 1923. Shortly after Lenin
                suffered two separate strokes.
              </p>
              <p>
                As the <b>Soviet union</b> (Union of Soviet Socialist Republics)
                was officially declared under a strict <b>one party-system</b> ,
                Lenin's health continued to decline and his ability to lead the
                communist party went with it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Everybody assumed Trotsky would succeed him as he was a great
                speaker and he'd won the civil war. The last person anyone
                expected to take over was Stalin.

              <h3>Stalin's Rise to Power</h3>
              <p>
                After the revolution, a new government was formed comprising
                mainly Bolsheviks. Lenin nominated Stalin as the party's new
                <b>General Secretary</b> .
              </p>
              <p>
                As secretary, he had the power to give people jobs within the
                party. So he started giving jobs to all of his friends and
                loyalists who in turn would give him their support. Lenin took
                note of Stalin abusing his position. But by this stage he was
                just too sick to fight it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Vladimir Lenin, died on 21 January 1924. Petrograd (St.
                Petersburg) was renamed <b>Leningrad</b>. This name remained
                until 1991, after which it was changed back to Saint Petersburg.
              </p>
              <p>
                By the time Lenin died, Stalin was too powerful to remove. He
                had his remaining opponents arrested or killed. Trotsky was
                banished and fled to Europe (eventually he would be assassinated
                by Soviet spies in 1940).
              </p>
              <h3>Stalin's Collectivization</h3>
              <p>
                After 1917, land had been given over to peasants. But the food
                shortages continued. Stalin believed that shortages were partly
                due to the small size of holdings. These small-sized peasant
                farms could not be modernised. He also believed that in order to
                develop modern farms, and run them along industrial lines with
                machinery, it was necessary to take away land from peasants, and
                establish state-controlled large farms.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 1929 Stalin proposed the <b>first five-year plan</b> in which
                he started collectivization of agriculture. As a part of the
                plan, the government took control of agriculture and collective
                farms (kolkhozes) were established. Individual peasants (kulaks)
                were forced off their land.
              </p>
              <p>
                Peasants were forced to work on the collective land, and the
                kolkhoz profit was to be shared. Those who resisted
                collectivisation were severely punished. Many were deported and
                exiled.
              </p>
              <p>
                In spite of collectivisation, production did not increase
                immediately. In fact, the bad harvests of 1930-1933 led to one
                of most devastating famines in Soviet history when over 4
                million died.
              </p>
              <p>
                Penalties were introduced, and many citizens were prosecuted for
                criticizing the government. The labor provided by convicts
                working in the labor camps of the <b>Gulag system</b> became an
                important component of the industrialization effort. An
                estimated 18 million people passed through the Gulag system, and
                perhaps another 15 million had experience of some other form of
                forced labor.
              </p>
              <p>
                Aside from Agriculture, Russia, in many measures the poorest
                nation in Europe at the time of the Bolshevik Revolution, now
                <b>industrialized at a phenomenal rate</b>.

                  Lenin vs Stalin: ideological differences
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Lenin had waited so long to take control in Russia but he
                  never got to see his communist utopia. His short time in
                  charge was spent dealing with the destroyed Russian economy,
                  World War One and the civil war. He was cruel and merciless,
                  but he really did seem to believe communism would make Russia
                  a better place.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Stalin on the other hand, would take the Soviet Union down a
                  different path. A secret police state, a rapidly militarizing
                  superpower led by a man who deeply distrusted the West and
                  would see the world come to the brink of nuclear annihilation.
