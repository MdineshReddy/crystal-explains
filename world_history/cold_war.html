              <p>
                The Cold War was an ideological conflict between the USSR which
                stood for communism and the USA which stood for capitalism, that
                played out globally. It is believed to be started on 12 March
                1947 with Truman Doctrine and ended on 26 December 1991 with the
                Dissolution of the Soviet Union.

              <h2>Background</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                United States and Soviet Russia fought on the same side during
                the World War 2. Towards the end of the war, The alliance
                between the Western Allies and the Soviet Union had begun to
                deteriorate.
              </p>
              <p>
                Stalin’s distrust of the U.S. and Britain kept growing as they
                refused to invade Europe and open up a second front against the
                Nazis. And some even say that the decision to drop the first
                Atomic Bombs on Japan was motivated in part by a desire to
                intimidate the Soviets. Soviets were not intimidated but
                motivated to develop atomic bombs of their own which they
                successfully tested in 1949.
              </p>
              <p>
                U.S. feared that the Soviets wanted to destroy democratic and
                capitalist institutions. And the Soviets feared that the US
                wanted to use its money and power to dominate Europe and
                eventually destroy the Soviet system.
              </p>
              <p>
                After World War 2, Germany, along with its capital Berlin was
                divided into two parts. The East Germany came under the Soviet
                Influence.
              </p>
              <p>
                Immediately after World War 2, the Soviets created a sphere of
                influence in eastern european nations of East Germany, Poland,
                Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Albania, which
                is why Winston Churchill famously said in 1946 that an
                <b>“Iron Curtain”</b> had descended across Europe. The
                relationship between the old Allies was deteriorating fast.
              </p>

              <h2>Cold War</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <h3>Truman's Doctrine</h3>
              <p>
                Truman Doctrine announced on 12 March 1947 by the U.S President
                Harry S. Truman. It called for a policy of
                <b>containment</b> which basically involved stopping the spread
                of communism by standing up to the Soviets wherever they seemed
                to want to expand.
              </p>
              <p>
                In Europe this meant spending a lot of money. First the
                <b> Marshall Plan</b> spent $13 billion on re-building western
                Europe with grants and credits that Europeans would spend on
                post-war re-construction. This plan led to the establishment of
                <b>Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development</b>
                (OECD) in 1961.
              </p>
              <p>
                Truman doctrine also lead to military containment by the
                creation of <b> North Atlantic Treaty Organization</b> (NATO) in
                1949, whereby its independent member states agree to mutual
                defence in response to an attack by any external party.
              </p>
              <h3>Marshall Plan and Comecon</h3>
              <p>
                Under Marshall plan, the US government gave to Western European
                countries over $13 billion to rebuild their economy. The plan's
                aim was to rebuild the democratic and economic systems of Europe
                and to counter perceived threats to Europe's balance of power,
                such as communist parties seizing control through revolutions or
                elections.
              </p>
              <div class="note">
                <p>
                  One month later, Truman signed the National Security Act of
                  1947, creating a unified Department of Defense, the Central
                  Intelligence Agency (CIA), and the National Security Council
                  (NSC). These would become the main bureaucracies for US
                  defense policy in the Cold War.
                </p>
              </div>
              <p>
                If the Western nations developed faster and better than the
                East, that would be a defeat for Stalin. So he set up his own
                rival economic recovery plan in 1949 called
                <b>Molotov Plan</b> which was eventually expanded to become the
                <b>Comecon</b> (Council for Mutual Economic Assistance).
              </p>
              <p>
                This was a full-on economic battle raging between capitalism and
                communism in Europe. But nowhere did this economic battle rage
                harder than in the city of Berlin. The city had been divided up
                between the Allies. And the western segments were still under
                Western control. East Berliners could travel freely to West
                Berlin and envy the economic prosperity of the West.
              </p>
              <div class="note">
                <h3 style="text-align: center">Espionage</h3>
                <p>
                  The two sides were spying on each other a whole lot throughout
                  the Cold War. The most famous and active organizations were
                  the American CIA, the Soviet KGB, and the British MI6.
                  Espionage took place all over the world, but Berlin was the
                  most important battleground for spying activity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The KGB had spies and informants in nearly every aspect of
                  Western life and government. Members of the Manhattan Project
                  (that developed atom bomb) aided the Soviet Union in building
                  its own atom bomb.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The CIA was also involved in European politics and elections
                  where communists had a chance, as in Italy. US had an edge
                  over the Soviet Union in its espionage technology. In
                  particular, U-2 spy planes flew across Russia carrying out
                  surveillance from the skies.
                </p>
              </div>
              <h3>Berlin Blockade and Airlift</h3>
              <p>
                In 1947, US, UK and later France (1949) decided to unite their
                part of occupation zones in the western half of Germany into
                Trizonia or West Germany. Shortly thereafter, Stalin instituted
                the Berlin Blockade (24 June 1948 – 12 May 1949), one of the
                first major crises of the Cold War, preventing food, materials
                and supplies from arriving in West Berlin.
              </p>
              <p>
                In response, the US, Britain, France, Canada, Australia, New
                Zealand and several other countries began the massive "Berlin
                airlift", supplying West Berlin with food and other provisions.
                The Berlin Airlift was an incredible undertaking and a major
                success for the Western Allies. Stalin ended his blockade of
                West Berlin (12 May 1949).
              </p>
              <div class="note">
                <h3 style="text-align: center">soviet atomic bomb project</h3>
                On 29 August 1949, the Soviet Union secretly conducted its first
                successful weapon test in a test site in Kazakh SSR. The USA no
                longer had a nuclear monopoly. The world now knew that if a
                major war broke out between the two superpowers, it would be
                more destructive than anyone could imagine.
              </div>
              <h3>China Becomes Communist</h3>
              <p>
                After China lost the Opium War against British in 19th Century,
                resulting in European domination, all of which was deeply
                embarrassing to the Qing dynasty and led to calls for reform.
              </p>
              <p>
                One strand of reform that called for China to adopt European
                military technology and education systems was called
                <b>self-strengthening</b>, But it didn't happen. Instead, China
                experienced an anti-Western Boxer Rebellion of 1900, which
                helped spur some young liberals, including one named
                <b>Sun Yat Sen</b>
                to plot the overthrow of the dynasty.
              </p>
              <div class="note">
                Sun Yat Sen is called the "Father of the Nation" in the Republic
                of China (now Taiwan), and the "Forerunner of the Revolution" in
                the People's Republic of China for his instrumental role in the
                overthrow of the Qing dynasty during the Xinhai Revolution.
              </div>
              <p>
                The 1911 revolution (Xinhai Revolution) led to the end of the
                Qing dynasty. The Qing emperor abdicated and Sun Yat Sen was
                declared president of a
                <b>provisional government of the Republic of China</b> in 1912.
                After the first elections, Sun Yat Sen’s party, the Kuomintang
                (KMT) (Nationalist Party) were the largest, but they weren’t the
                majority. So, Sun Yat Sen turned power over to to
                <b>Yuan Shikai</b> (a General), which turned out to be a huge
                mistake because he abolished the national and provincial
                assemblies and declared himself as the emperor of China in late
                1915.
              </p>
              <p>
                But when Yuan Shikai died in 1916, creating a power vacuum; This
                opened the way for the Warlord Era, during which much of China
                was ruled by shifting coalitions of competing provincial
                military leaders.
              </p>
              <p>
                The leaders of Kuomintang and of Chinese Communist Party (CCP)
                formed an alliance to regain power from those big landlords and
                reunify China. But then Sun Yat Sen died in 1925, and one of his
                proteges, <b>Chiang Kai-shek</b>, seized control of the
                Nationalist Party. The alliance between the nationalists and
                communists fell apart in 1927 which started a civil war which
                lasted till 1949. In the end, The CCP, under the leadership of
                <b>Mao Zedong</b>, successfully defeated the Kuomintang, who
                retreated to Taiwan.
              </p>
              <p>
                The CCP was left in control of mainland China. On 1 October
                1949, Mao Zedong proclaimed the People's Republic of China.
                Soviet Union promptly created an alliance with the newly formed
                People's Republic of China.
              </p>
              <h3>Korean War</h3>
              <p>
                After the Second World War, Korea was divided into two parts. In
                the north, the Soviets set up a communist regime. In the south,
                America set up an anti-communist regime. North was under Kim
                Il-sung and South was under Rhee Syng-Man. Both were dictators
                and both dreamed of reuniting Korea under their own regime.
              </p>
              <p>
                The North launched a surprise invasion of the South on June
                25th, 1950. With Soviet aid, the North Koreans steamrolled
                through, taking Seoul in just three days. The UN created an
                emergency force made up of troops from 16 countries to defend

                In the north, Kim Il Sung created a highly centralized,
                totalitarian dictatorship that accorded his family unlimited
                power. In the South, the American-backed dictator Syngman Rhee
                ran a violently anticommunist and authoritarian regime. While
                Rhee was overthrown in 1960, South Korea continued to be ruled

                Famed World War II general, <b>Dwight D. Eisenhower</b>, was
                elected as new U.S President in January, 1953. Two Months later
                Stalin died. The new Soviet leader <b>Nikita Khrushchev</b> went
                on a campaign of <b>de-Stalinization</b> from 1956. Statues of
                Stalin were taken down, Stalingrad was renamed Volgograd, and
                Khrushchev announced that he wanted the Soviet people to be
                happy and would allow greater freedom in the Soviet Union. He
                permitted more cultural expression, but then began banning stuff
                based on his own personal taste.

                West Germany was allowed to join NATO in 1955. Soviets set up
                the defensive <b>Warsaw Pact</b> as a balance of power or
                counterweight to NATO, by strengthening the military ties
                between the Soviet Union and its satellite states. There was no
                direct military confrontation between them; instead, the
                conflict was fought on an ideological basis and in proxy wars.

              <p>
                <b>John F. Kennedy</b> became president of the United States in
                1961.
              </p>
              <p>
                The contrast between the economically prosperous West and the
                struggling East was clearer day-by-day and East Berliners were
                still able to freely travel to the West. Many of them were
                deciding to stay there. Millions defected to West Germany via
                West Berlin, causing Eastern factories to lose workers, and
                taking a heavy toll on the economy.
              </p>
              <p>
                Khrushchev came up with a new idea to build a wall. On August
                13th, 1961, Berliners woke up to find their city divided into
                two; with barbed wire and guards blocking the border between
                East and West. Over time, a wall (Berlin Wall) was constructed
                in its place across the city.
              </p>
              <p>
                Families were torn apart. Thousands would risk their lives
                escaping over the wall and hundreds would die trying. To the
                despair of Berliners, the West were unable to do anything about
                it. But the wall did put on full display the failure of the
                communist system. As Kennedy said (June 26, 1963): "Freedom has
                many difficulties and Democracy is not perfect, but we have
                never had to put a wall up to keep our people in."

                Assassination and Khrushchev's ousting
              </h3>
              <p>
                In Cuba two young socialist revolutionaries
                <b>Fidel Castro</b> and <b>Che Guevara</b> seized power toppling
                the elected President in 1959. Cuba began negotiating for arms
                purchases from the Eastern Bloc in March 1960. In January 1961,
                just prior to leaving office, Eisenhower formally severed
                relations with the Cuban government and gave approval to CIA
                plans and funding to overthrow Castro.
              </p>
              <p>
                Kennedy wanted to conceal any US involvement in the overthrowing
                plan. So he massively scaled back American air support, and as a
                result the <b>Bay of Pigs Invasion</b> was a humiliating defeat
                for America. Kennedy administration continued seeking ways to
                oust Castro experimenting with various ways of covertly
                facilitating the overthrow of the Cuban government.
              </p>
              <p>
                Khrushchev made preparations to install Soviet nuclear missiles
                in Cuba, to which Castro agreed. Alarmed, Kennedy responded with
                a naval blockade. The US navy announced it would stop and search
                any Soviet ships heading to Cuba. And would sink any that did
                not comply. In response, the Soviet put its military into full
                combat readiness. The US did the same, and began drawing up
                plans for an attack on Cuba. Things were escalating fast, and
                both superpowers were getting ready for nuclear annihilation.
              </p>
              <p>
                A Soviet nuclear submarine in the Caribbean mistakenly believed
                war had already broken out and two of the senior officers gave
                the go-ahead to fire its nuclear torpedo. Thankfully the third
                senior officer, Vasili Arkhipov, refused to authorise the
                decision.
              </p>
              <p>
                After much deliberation between the Soviet Union and Kennedy's
                cabinet, Kennedy pledged not to invade Cuba again and secretly
                agreed to remove all missiles set in Turkey on the border of the
                Soviet Union, in exchange for Khrushchev removing all missiles
                in Cuba.

                On November 22, 1963, President Kennedy was assassinated by Lee
                Harvey Oswald. In 1964, Khrushchev's Kremlin colleagues managed

                Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard Nixon and Vietnam War (1955-1975)
              </h3>
              <p>
                After Kennedy's assassination, Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson
                took over. And he inherited a developing crisis in Vietnam.
                Instead of direct conflict, the US and Soviet Union involved in
                a lot of Proxy wars, famous of which is the Vietnam war.
              </p>
              <p>
                After the French were ousted from Vietnam in 1950s, it was
                divided into two. In the North, a communist regime and in the
                South, an anti-communist regime. North Vietnam was under Ho Chi
                Minh and South was under Ngo Dinh Diem. They both dreamed of
                reuniting Vietnam under their own regime.
              </p>
              <p>
                The North established the National Liberation Front, also known
                as the <b>Vietcong</b>, to carry out a campaign of guerrilla
                warfare in the South with Soviet support. The US sent advisors
                to help train the South Vietnamese to deal with the threat, but
                President Diem's brutal policies pushed more and more South
                Vietnamese to support the Vietcong.
              </p>
              <p>
                And over the next decade, the situation escalated to a breaking
                point. America feared the <b>Domino Effect</b>, that if South
                Vietnam fell to communism, the neighbouring nations would also
                move towards communism. So, the US got bogged down in one of its
                most brutal and longest wars while the Soviets assisted the
                North Vietnamese army in the Viet Cong.

                Richard Nixam became president in 1968. As the Vietnam War
                appeared to be increasingly unwinnable, and public opinion
                turning increasingly sour, Nixon made the decision to begin
                bringing the troops home, and ended US involvement in Vietnam by
                1973. Two years later, the war ended with the capture of Saigon,
                the capital of South Vietnam by the People's Army of Vietnam
                (PAVN) and the Viet Cong on 30 April 1975.

                The Cold War was now taking its toll on both superpowers. In
                Russia, a huge percentage of the budget was still going to the
                military and not towards the people. Both sides needed to reduce
                spending in order to rescue their economies.

                Both Nixon and Brezhnev proclaimed a new era of "peaceful

                To improve relations, Nixon became the first US President to
                visit Moscow in 1972. And Brezhnev returned the favour a year
                later. A number of treaties were signed, including the 1972 SALT
                I (Strategic Arms Limitation Talks) agreement, that limited

                  involving the administration of U.S. President Richard Nixon.

              <h3>New Cold War (1979–1985)</h3>
              <p>
                The term new Cold War refers to the period of intensive
                reawakening of Cold War tensions and conflicts in the late 1970s
                and early 1980s. Tensions greatly increased between the major
                powers with both sides becoming more militant.
              </p>
              <p>
                Gerald Ford was followed by Jimmy Carter who was followed by
                <b>Ronald Reagan</b> as the new US President (1981). Both Reagan
                and new British Prime Minister
                <b>Margaret Thatcher</b> denounced the Soviet Union and its
                ideology. Reagan labeled the Soviet Union an
                <b>"evil empire"</b> and predicted that Communism would be left
                on the "ash heap of history," while Thatcher inculpated the
                Soviets as "bent on world dominance."
              </p>
              <p>
                Reagan wanted to renew the arms race using technological
                advances in computing. The Soviet Union did not respond by
                further building its military, because the enormous military
                expenses, along with inefficient planned manufacturing and
                collectivized agriculture, were already a heavy burden for the
                Soviet economy.
              </p>
              <p>
                On 1 September 1983, the Soviets shot down a Korean airliner
                that had strayed into their airspace. And it looked like the
                world was going right back to mid-20th-century Cold War tension.
                NATO coordinated exercise to simulate a nuclear conflict. It was
                perhaps the most dangerous moment since the Cuban Missile
                Crisis, as the Soviet leadership feared that a nuclear attack
                might be imminent.

                Brezhnev died in 1982, and was ultimately replaced by
                <b>Mikhail Gorbachev</b> in 1985.
              </p>
              <h3>Gorbachev's reforms</h3>
              <p>
                Gorbachev's philosophy differed a lot from previous Soviet
                leaders. He felt that the reason the Soviet system and economy
                was struggling was that it didn't allow the Soviet people to
                find satisfaction in their work. Because they weren't allowed to
                speak freely, and lived in fear. Gorbachev wanted the Soviet
                people to be happy. But unlike previous Soviet leaders, he
                actually made the change happen.
              </p>
              <p>
                He announced an agenda of economic reform called
                <b>perestroika</b>, or restructuring. Perestroika allowed
                private ownership of businesses and paved the way for foreign
                investment. He simultaneously introduced <b>glasnost</b>, or
                openness, which increased freedom of the press and the
                transparency of state institutions. Glasnost led to more
                information from the west and less censorship led to a flood of
                criticism as people realized how much poorer the second world
                was than the first
              </p>
              <p>
                He also knew that the arms race needed to end in order to rescue
                the Soviet economy, and a positive relationship with the West
                must be established.
              </p>
              <p>
                Reagan's tone towards the Soviet Union began to soften, and he
                agreed to renew talks on economic issues and the scaling-back of
                the arms race. Constructive dialogue reopened and resulted in
                the INF Treaty, which saw all intermediate-range missiles
                eliminated.
              </p>
              <h3>Eastern Europe breaks away</h3>
              <p>
                For decades, the Soviets had been brutally repressing any
                attempt at change in their satellite states in Eastern Europe.
                But now Gorbachev was prepared to let the Eastern Bloc choose
                its own future.
              </p>
              <p>
                And one by one, often quite suddenly, former communist states
                collapsed. The Iron Curtain was unravelling. In a historic
                movement, the Berlin Wall came down in November 1989, which
                symbolized the collapse of European communist governments. After
                decades of family separation and travel restriction, the people
                were allowed to pass through. East and West Berliners couldn't
                believe it, and celebrated together throughout the night. Some
                even climbed the wall, and began to topple it. The Iron Curtain
                had fallen and in 1990, Germany was reunited.

                In Poland, the anti-Soviet party, Solidarity, won 99 out of 100
                seats in the 1989 election. Hungary held multiparty elections in
                1990. Elections in Bulgaria, a peaceful revolution in
                Czechoslovakia, and a violent one in Romania, brought to an end
                communist authority in the Eastern Bloc.

              <h3>Soviet dissolution</h3>
              <p>
                In the USSR itself, glasnost weakened the ideological bonds that
                held the Soviet Union together. People wanted an end to the
                communist single-party rule and Gorbachev had to give in.
              </p>
              <p>
                For the first time in history, elections were held in which
                candidates not officially endorsed by the party were allowed to
                run. Ambitious rival of Gorbachev, <b>Boris Yeltsin</b> led a
                growing democratic movement and won the democratic presidential
                elections for the Russian republic.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Hard-line Communist opponents of Gorbachev's reform program,
                angry at the loss of control over East European satellites, and
                fearful of the new union treaty that was about to be signed
                which would decentralize much of the central government's power
                to the <b>15 republics</b>. So they planned a coup (Augusty Coup
                1991).
              </p>
              <p>
                The hard-liners were very poorly organized. They met defeat by a
                short but effective campaign of civil resistance mainly in
                Moscow. It was led by Russian president Boris Yeltsin. The coup
                collapsed in only two days and Gorbachev returned to office,
                while all the plotters lost office.
              </p>
              <p>
                Yeltsin became the dominant leader and Gorbachev lost much of
                his influence. The failed coup led to both the immediate
                collapse of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the
                dissolution of the USSR on 26 December 1991.
