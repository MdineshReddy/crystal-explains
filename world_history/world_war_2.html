                World War II or the Second World War lasted from 1939 to 1945
                and involved almost all the countries of the world. The
                Participants were grouped into two alliances.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>The Axis Powers</b>: Germany, Japan and Italy were the
                  Major Axis Powers.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>The Allies</b>: UK, Soviet Union (USSR) and US were major
                  among the Allies.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                World War II is generally considered to have begun on
                <b>1 September 1939</b>, when Nazi Germany, under Adolf Hitler,
                invaded Poland.

              </p>
              <p>
                The definite cause of the war is unbridled military expansion by
                Germany, Japan, and, to a small extent, Italy.
              </p>
              <h3>Italy</h3>
              <p>
                Italy under Mussolini seized Abyssinia (in Africa) from
                Ethiopia. Italy also wanted to control the entrance to the
                Adriatic Sea. So they occupied Albania.
              </p>
              <h3>Japan</h3>
              <p>
                China appealed to the League of Nations to stop the Japanese
                invasion of Manchuria (1931). Japan withdrew from the League of
                Nations after being condemned for its incursion into Manchuria.
                The two nations then fought several battles until a Truce was
                signed in 1933. Thereafter, Chinese volunteer forces continued
                the resistance to Japanese aggression.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 1937, there was another incident (that may have been planned
                by the Japanese Army) called
                <b>Marco Polo Bridge Incident</b> (7 July 1937) where gunfire
                was exchanged by Japanese and Chinese troops at the Marco Polo
                Bridge. This incident is generally reckoned as the start of the
                <b>Second Sino-Japanese War</b> (1937-1945) in which Japanese
                launched yet another invasion against China. They swept through
                Peking (Beijing) and Shanghai, and then advanced through the
                Yangtze Valley to China's then-capital, <b>Nanking</b>. It was
                here that saw the worst of Japan's brutal atrocities committed
                against the Chinese people and is still so controversial today
                that it affects relations between Japan & China.
              </p>
              <p>
                This full-scale war between the Chinese and the Empire of Japan
                is often regarded as the beginning of World War II in Asia.
              </p>
              <h3>Germany</h3>
              <p>
                Hitler started undoing the Treaty of Versailles, he set up a
                fighter-wing unit called <b>Luftwaffe</b> to carry on aerial
                warfare. Then followed a massive <b>re-armament program</b> and
                complusory military service i.e., <b>conscription</b> to expand
                the army. He remilitarised the Rhineland (western Germany) in
                March 1936.
              </p>
              <p>
                The allies followed a policy of <b>Appeasement</b>, a diplomatic
                policy of making political or material concessions to an
                aggressive power in order to avoid conflict. Hitler wanted to
                create more <b>Lebensraum</b> (living space) for Germany, so, he
                seized Austria and Czechoslovakia with little resistance from
                other European powers.
              </p>
              <p>
                Italy and Germany signed <b>Pact of Steel</b> (22 May 1939) to
                continuing trust and co-operation between Germany and Italy.
              </p>
              <p>
                Hitler hated the <b>Polish Corridor</b> that split Germany into
                two. The Allies warned him that an invasion of Poland would mean
                war. Hitler had planned to continue his advance eastward, but he
                didn't want to end up fighting a war on two fronts. So, he
                signed <b>Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact</b>, a non-aggression pact (23
                Aug 1939) with Soviet Union, led by Joseph Stalin that included
                a secret agreement to partition Poland between the two
                countries.
              </p>
              <h2>The War</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                On the 1 September 1939, German troops entered Poland, and
                Britain and France declared war on Germany. The Poles fought
                hard, but they were no match for the German Army.
              </p>
              <h3>The Phoney War</h3>
              <p>
                The eight-month period at the start of World War II was referred
                to as the Period of Phoney War where there was no major
                hostilities on the Western Front.
              </p>
              <p>
                The French had launched a small invasion into the Saar Land
                (western German State), but they maintained mostly defensive
                positions, that too for a short period. After the World War 1,
                France did not do much to improve its army and technology. They
                built a line of defenses along their German border (<b
                  >Maginot Line</b
                >) but did not extend all the way to the English Channel.
                Meaning, it could be bipassed by going through Belgium,
                Netherlands, and Luxembourg, which Hitler exactly did.
              </p>
              <p>
                And at first, the UK wasn't much better. UK Prime Minister
                Chamberlain still naively hoped that the war could be ended
                diplomatically. Instead of bombing raids, the Royal Air Force
                (RAF) dropped propaganda leaflets over German cities which had
                little to no effect. They also only sent 200,000 men to France,
                while the French had mobilised millions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Both Britain and France wanted to avoid a repeat of the First
                World War, and so they wanted to keep the war as far from home
                as possible. So they turned their eyes north, towards Norway.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sweden was neutral but it was exporting iron ore to Germany,
                through Norway which was also neutral. So the Allies asked them
                to stop exporting iron ore to Germany which they refused.
                Britain and France started naval blockade and mined the waters
                around Norway to force any transport ships into international
                waters.
              </p>
              <p>
                Hitler realised what the Allies were up to, and he quickly moved
                to secure his supply of iron ore. He launched an invasion
                through Denmark into Norway. The Allies rushed to land troops
                along the coast, but Germany had taken control of Norway's
                airfields, and with their air superiority, decided to fight.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Allies had to retreat. After the embarrassing failure of
                Norwegian campaign , Chamberlain resigned. And was replaced with
                <b>Winston Churchill</b> as Prime Minister on 10 May 1940.
              </p>
              <div class="note">
                <p>
                  In November 1939, Soviet Union attacked Finland. Despite
                  overwhelming numerical superiority, it became a humiliating
                  struggle for Soviet Union and their military ineptitude was
                  put on full display. In the end they did force the Finns to
                  sue for peace (March 1940) with minimal finnish concessions.
                  Then they continued their campaign of pushing around much
                  smaller countries by annexing the baltic states of Estonia,
                  Lativa, Lithuania, and part of northern Romania (which later
                  became Moldova). Which were setup as Soviet Socialist
                  Republics.
                </p>
              </div>
              <h3>France's Invasion</h3>
              <p>
                Hitler's overall strategy was similar to Germany's WW1 strategy.
                Attack and defeat France, knocking out the UK in the process on
                the Western Front, then turn on the Soviet Union on the Eastern
                front and win the war.
              </p>
              <p>
                The period of Phony War with the Allies had given Hitler enough
                time to prepare his forces. Hitler launched an invasion on
                neutral Belgium, Netherlands and Luxembourg to get around
                France's defenses. The Allies charged into Belgium at full
                speed, to meet the German invasion head-on, and it looked like a
                repeat of the First World War was coming.
              </p>
              <p>
                But Germany followed a new Strategy called <b>Blitzkrieg</b>. It
                was characterized by a swift movement of troops, tanks, and
                massive use of air power to support infantry movements. In the
                very early years of the war, it was extremely effective.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Germans carried out a flanking manoeuvre through the
                <b>Ardennes (forest) region</b>, which was mistakenly perceived
                by Allies as an impenetrable natural barrier against armoured
                vehicles. But the Germans squeezed in from all sides, taking out
                France's best armies, and nearly wiping out the British, too.
                But they managed to make a desperate last-minute escape at
                <b>Dunkirk</b> ( 26 May to 4 June 1940), with British civilian
                ships even making the perilous journey to bring their young men
                home.
              </p>
              <p>
                On 10 June, Italy invaded France, declaring war on both France
                and the United Kingdom. With most of the French forces depleted,
                the Germans breezed through, taking Paris, and France fell on 14
                June 1940. Hitler occupied only the coastal areas of France for
                defense, but allowed it to continue its existence as a German
                puppet state.
              </p>
              <p>
                With the fall of france, Hitler hoped now all alone UK would
                also lose hope and sue for peace. But it didn't.
              </p>
              <h3>Air Battle with Britain (The Blitz)</h3>
              <p>
                The United Kingdom rejected Hitler's peace offer, and the
                <b>German air superiority campaign</b>
                started in August. Waves of German bombers flew over Britain,
                while the completely outnumbered RAF (Royal Air Force) worked
                bravely around the clock in an attempt to quell the German
                attacks.
              </p>
              <p>
                At first, the Luftwaffe targeted British ports and coastal
                facilities, then it attacked RAF bases, crippling the RAF's
                ability to defend the nation. Churchill ordered a small, pretty
                insignificant bombing raid over Berlin.
              </p>
              <p>
                Furious, Hitler immediately ordered the Luftwaffe to refocus its
                attacks on civilian targets in London. Children were sent off to
                the countryside, away from their parents, to avoid danger. And
                frequent trips to air-raid shelters became a daily occurrence.
              </p>
              <p>
                This refocusing on London also gave the RAF time to reorganise.
                So when the Luftwaffe sent one massive all-out attack on London,
                the RAF successfully repelled it, destroying many of the German
                aircraft, and placing air superiority firmly in British hands.
                Hitler's invasion had to be postponed, but the bombing of
                British cities continued for some time.
              </p>
              <h3>New Participants</h3>
              <p>
                On the Allies side, many Commonwealth nations and other allied
                colonies had joined the war in Britain support. They would play
                a key role throughout the war particularly in the African and
                Italian campaigns. France's colonies in Equatorial Africa also
                pledged their allegiance to free France. Churchill requested
                <b>Franklin D. Roosevelt</b> (of USA) to join on Allies side.
                Roosevelt refused, but helped the allies by supplying food,
                weapons and ammunitions
              </p>
              <p>
                At the end of September 1940, the
                <b>Tripartite Pact</b> formally united Japan, Italy, and Germany
                as the Axis powers. Later Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania also
                joined. Romania wanted to recapture territory ceded to the
                Soviet Union.
              </p>
              <h3>New Technology</h3>
              <p>
                German u-boats were sinking thousands of Allied supply ships in
                the Atlantic including American ones in the hopes that if the
                Germans could sever Britain's supply line then UK would starve.
              </p>
              <p>
                Throughout the war the Allies had to come up with better
                technology to fight the u-boats. Improved radar aircraft with
                longer range better, anti-aircraft weaponry and convoy tactics.
                In the end, <b>Alan Turing</b> and his team of code breakers
                cracked Germany's Enigma code to intercept and decrypt german
                orders and messages. The u-boats gradually became less and less
                of a threat.
              </p>
              <h3>Axis attack on the Soviet Union (1941)</h3>
              <p>
                Hitler believed that the UK's refusal to end the war was based
                on the hope that the US and the Soviet Union would enter the war
                against Germany sooner or later. He therefore, decided to try to
                strengthen Germany's relations with the Soviets or failing that
                to attack and eliminate them as a factor. In November 1940,
                negotiations took place to determine if the Soviet Union would
                join the Tripartite Pact. The Soviets showed some interest but
                asked for concessions from Finland, Bulgaria, Turkey, and Japan
                that Germany considered unacceptable.
              </p>
              <p>
                On 22 June 1941, Germany, supported by Italy, Romania, Finland
                and Hungary, invaded the Soviet Union in
                <b>Operation Barbarossa</b>. Stalin was far from ready, the
                Soviets (red army) didn't stand a chance and Germany made
                staggering progress with huge encircling movements capturing
                mind-boggling numbers of Russian troops at major cities.
                Leningrad was put under siege.
              </p>
              <p>
                Germany's ultimate goal included the eventual extermination,
                enslavement, Germanization and mass deportation to Siberia of
                the Slavic peoples, and to create more Lebensraum (living space)
                for Germany.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Eastern Front of the Second World War was brutal for all
                that endured it. A major offensive against Moscow was launched;
                after two months of fierce battles in increasingly harsh
                weather, the German army almost reached the outer suburbs of
                Moscow, where the exhausted troops were forced to suspend their
                offensive because of extreme cold. Stalin called in troops from
                the Siberian front, specially trained to fight in the extreme
                cold and the Germans were no match. They were now being pushed
                back and had no choice but to dig in and wait for winter to end.
              </p>
              <h3>Japan's Expansion and America's Entry</h3>
              <p>
                Japan's war in China had come to a standstill and they wanted to
                keep expending the sphere of influence. Southeast Asia and
                Pacific Islands ware heavily colonized by America and Great
                Britain. It was also full of ocean. Japanese Navy could stand up
                to that of the US and the UK.
              </p>
              <p>
                So Japan planned to destroy their navies before starting the
                conquest. On December 7 1941, Japanese launched a surprise air
                raid on the US Pacific Fleet at <b>Pearl Harbor</b> (Hawaii) and
                inflicted a huge amount of damage. They also attacked British
                colonies in Southeast Asia.
              </p>
              <p>
                Roosevelt and Churchill declared war on Japan. Hitler then
                declared war on America even though he didn't have to.
              </p>
              <p>
                Meanwhile Japan took Guam, the Gilbert Islands, Wake Island,
                Hong Kong, Philippines, and forced Thailand to join them so they
                can March their troops through to Malaya. They swept through
                Singapore, North Borneo, the East Indies, New Guinea, the
                Solomons and they were now threatening northern Australia and
                conquered Burma and reached the borders of India.
              </p>
              <p>
                Japan's victory had been as staggering as the Germans. But as
                with the Germans, their victories had been based on speed not
                power and power would eventually catch up.
              </p>

              <h3>Eastern Front (1942–43)</h3>
              <p>
                With winter over, Germans launched their main summer offensive
                against southern Russia in June 1942, to seize the oil fields of
                the Caucasus.
              </p>
              <p>Germans split its army into two groups:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Army Group A advanced to the lower Don River and struck
                  south-east to the Caucasus and
                </li>
                <li>
                  Army Group B headed towards the Volga River to capture
                  Stalingrad (now known as Volgograd), a key city.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The German attack on Stalingrad was one of the bloodiest battles
                in the history of war, with more than two million dead. The
                Germans began by dropping more than 1,000 tons of bombs on
                Stalingrad, and then the Russians responded by “hugging” the
                Germans, staying as close to their front lines as possible so
                that German air support would kill Germans and Russians alike.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Germans had nearly taken Stalingrad, but the Soviets were
                now better prepared and in an attack that resembled Hitler's own
                encirclement tactics, sixth army of the Nazis were completely
                cut off. After that, due partly to Hitler’s overreaching
                megalomania and partly to soldiers being scared of him, the
                sixth army slowly froze and starved to death before finally
                surrendering. And of the 91,000 Axis POWs from Stalingrad, only
                about 6,000 ever returned home.
              </p>
              <p>
                With complete air superiority, the Soviets started pushing
                westward. For Stalin, it was a resounding victory, for Hitler an
                absolute catastrophe.
              </p>
              <h3>Allies gain momentum (1943–44)</h3>
              <p>
                When Japan tried to capture the Island of Midway, US Navy was
                ready for the attack and they sank Japan's carriers from which
                the Japanese Navy would never recover. American followed a
                strategy of
                <b>"island hopping or Leapfrogging"</b> in the Pacific, where in
                they went from island to island, liberating them and getting
                closer to mainland Japan.
              </p>
              <p>
                In March 1944, the Japanese launched the first of two invasions,
                an operation against British positions in Assam, India, and soon
                besieged Imphal and Kohima. In May 1944, British-Indian forces
                mounted a counter-offensive that drove Japanese troops back to
                Burma by July.
              </p>
              <p>
                American and British troops squeezed German and Italian troops
                out of Africa. With the axis Out of Africa, the Allies had to
                decide their next move: Churchill wanted to attack from the
                south starting with Italy. Roosevelt preferred full-on sea
                invasion in northern France. They went with both.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>From South:</b> Allies' <b>invasion of Sicily</b> (in
                  Italy) launched on 9 July 1943, which, combined with previous
                  Italian failures, resulted in the ousting and arrest of
                  Mussolini later that month.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>From North:</b> On 6 June 1944 (called <b>D-Day</b>), the
                  Ally troops of America, Britain and Canada landed at Normandy
                  in France, under the careful planning of
                  <b>General Dwight Eisenhower</b>. It was a tremendous struggle
                  with a great loss of life. Finally Paris was liberated and the
                  Germans were pushed out of France, as the Allies entered
                  Belgium. D-Day invasion of Normandy was the beginning of the
                  end for the Nazis.

              <h3>Axis collapse, Allied victory (1944–45)</h3>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                The allies suffered some setbacks trying to liberate the
                Netherlands but they were making progress and were now
                threatening the industrial heartland of Germany.
              </p>
              <p>
                On 16 December 1944, Germany made a last attempt on the Western
                Front by using most of its remaining reserves to launch a
                massive counter-offensive in the Ardennes region again. By
                January 1945, the offensive had been repulsed with no strategic
                objectives fulfilled.
              </p>
              <p>
                Hitler's last-ditch attempt had failed and what followed was a
                total collapse of the German forces. The Allies pushed into
                Germany from both sides. Soviet and Polish forces stormed and
                captured Berlin in late April. In Italy, German forces
                surrendered on 29 April.
              </p>
              <p>
                Several changes in leadership occurred during this period. On 12
                April, President Roosevelt died and was succeeded by Harry S.
                Truman. Clement Attlee replaced Churchill as Prime Minister.
                Benito Mussolini was killed by Italian partisans on 28 April.
                Two days later, Hitler committed suicide in besieged Berlin. Now
                only Japan remains who continued to fight rejecting the call for
                unconditional surrender.
              </p>
              <p>
                On August 6th and on August 9th, the United States dropped
                atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki
                respectively. The cities were reduced to rubble and for the
                people living there, it was a terrible fate. But for the Allies
                it achieved their main aim, in September the Emperor announced
                Japan's surrender.
              </p>
              <p>
                After six years, the war was finally over. The Allies occupied
                Japan for eight years, the Emperor was allowed to keep his
                position. Germany was divided between America, the UK, France
                and the Soviet Union. In 1949 the Allied sectors were united
                into West Germany (also called Federal Republic of Germany). The
                East Germany (also called German Democratic Republic) was under
                Soviet Influence.
              </p>

              <h2>Conclusion</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                The Second World War had been more terrible and destructive than
                the first. Some 60 million people died in the war, including
                about 20 million military personnel and 40 million civilians.
                Many of the civilians died because of deliberate genocide,
                massacres, mass bombings, disease, and starvation. World War II
                proved the latin proverb "homo homini lupus": Man is a wolf to
                man.
              </p>
              <p>
                Six million Jews were killed by the Nazis during the
                <b>Holocaust</b>, many by starvation and many through a
                chillingly planned effort of extermination in death camps. These
                death camps can be distinguished from concentration camps or
                labor camps in that their primary purpose was extermination of
                Jews, communists, homosexuals, disabled people, and others that
                the Nazis deemed unfit.
              </p>
              <p>
                More than a million British-Indians died, mainly due to famine
                (Bengal famine of 1943) that could have been avoided if the
                British had redistributed food. A famine in Vietnam (1944–45)
                who were at the time under Japanese control, killed a million or
                more.
              </p>
              <p>
                World War II saw modern industrial nations, which are supposed
                to represent the best of the Enlightenment and the Scientific
                Revolution, descend into unimaginable cruelty. While it’s
                tempting to say that World War II was about the Allies fighting
                for democratic ideals against the totalitarian, militaristic,
                imperialism of the fascist Axis powers, it just doesn’t hold up
                to scrutiny. For instance, a hugely important Allied power,
                Stalin’s Soviet Union, was the least democratic place, ever.
                And, by far, the biggest imperialists of the war were the
                British.
              </p>
              <h3>Aftermath</h3>
              <p>
                When war broke out in 1939, the League of Nations closed down
                and its headquarters in Geneva, which remained empty throughout
                the war. United Nations (UN) was established on 24 October 1945
                which succeeded the ineffective League of Nations.
              </p>
              <p>
                A denazification programme in Germany led to the prosecution of
                Nazi war criminals and the removal of ex-Nazis from power.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the aftermath of World War 2, two superpowers with two very
                different ideologies had come out victorious and the tension
                between the two of them would create a new kind of war, a very
                cold one. (
