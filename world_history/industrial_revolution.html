              <p>
                Although it occurred around the same time as the French,
                American, Latin American, and Haitian Revolutions - between,
                say, 1750 and 1850 - the industrial revolution was really the
                most revolutionary of the bunch.
              </p>
              <p>
                For the majority part of history, borders and flags have changed
                plenty, and they’re going to keep changing. But in all that
                time, nothing much changed about the way we disposed of waste or
                located drinking water or acquired clothing. Most people lived
                on or very close to the land that provided their food. Except
                for a few exceptions, life expectancy never rose above 35.
                Education was a privilege, not a right. In all those millennia,
                we never developed a weapon that could kill more than a couple
                dozen people at once, or a way to travel faster than horseback.
              </p>
              <p>
                You have electricity? Industrial Revolution. You live somewhere
                other than a farm? Industrial Revolution. You drive a car?
                Industrial Revolution. You get ten years of free, formal
                education? Industrial Revolution. Your bed, your antibiotics,
                your toilet, your tap water, your every waking and sleeping
                second: Industrial Revolution.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Industrial Revolution was an increase in production brought
                about by the use of machines and characterized by the use of new
                energy sources. The industrial revolution began around 1750 and
                it occurred across most of the earth, but it started in Europe,
                especially Britain.
              </p>
              <h2>British textile industry</h2>
              <p>
                The innovations of the Industrial Revolution were intimately
                interconnected. Like, look, for instance, at the British textile
                industry: The invention of the flying shuttle by John Kay in
                1733 dramatically increased the speed of weaving, which in turn
                created demand for yarn, which led to inventions like the
                Spinning Jenny and the water frame. Soon these processes were
                mechanized using water power, until the steam engine came along
                to make flying shuttles really fly in these huge cotton mills.
              </p>
              <p>
                The most successful steam engine was built by Thomas Newcomen to
                clear water out of mines. And because water was cleared out of
                those mines, there was more coal to power more steam engines,
                which eventually led to the fancying up of the Newcomen Steam
                Engine by James Watt, whose engine made possible not only
                railroads and steamboats but also ever-more-efficient cotton
                mills.
              </p>
              <p>
                And, for the first time, chemicals were being used to bleach the
                cloth that people wore -the first of which was sulfuric acid,
                which was created in large quantities only thanks to lead-lined
                chambers, which would’ve been impossible without lead production
                rising dramatically right around 1750 in Britain, thanks to lead
                foundries powered by coal.
              </p>
              <p>
                And all these factors came together to make more yarn that could
                be spun and bleached faster and cheaper than ever before.
              </p>
              <h2>Why Europe?</h2>
              <p>
                So, the problem here is that with industrialization being so
                deeply interconnected, it’s really difficult to figure out why
                it happened in Europe, especially Britain. And that question of
                why turns out to be one of the more contentious discussions in
                world history today. For instance, here are some Eurocentric
                reasons why industrialization might have happened first in
                Europe:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  There’s the cultural superiority argument that basically holds
                  that Europeans are just better and smarter than other people.
                  Sometimes this is formulated as Europeans possessing superior
                  rationality. (By the way, you’ll never guess where the people
                  who make this argument tend to come from - unless you guessed
                  that they come from Europe.)
                </li>
                <li>
                  And then, others argue that only Europe had the culture of
                  science and invention that made the creation of these
                  revolutionary technologies possible.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Another argument is that freer political institutions
                  encouraged innovation and strong property rights created
                  incentives for inventors.
                </li>
                <li>
                  And, finally, people often cite Europe’s small population
                  because small populations require labor-saving inventions.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h2>Why not China or India?</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                It’s really important to note that in 1800, it was not clear
                that Europe was going to become the world’s dominant
                manufacturing power in the next hundred years. At the time,
                China, India, and Europe were all roughly at the same place in
                terms of industrial production.
              </p>
              <h3>China</h3>
              <p>
                First, let’s look at China. It’s hard to make the European
                cultural superiority argument because China had been recording
                its history since before Confucius, and plus there was all that
                bronze and painting and poetry. It’s also kind of difficult to
                make a blanket statement that China was economically inferior to
                Europe, since they invented paper money and led the world in
                exports of everything from silk to china (plates). I mean,
                pre-Industrial Revolution, population growth was the surest sign
                of economic success, and China had the biggest population in the
                world.
              </p>
              <p>
                It’s also difficult to say that China lacked a culture of
                invention when they invented gunpowder, and printing, and paper,
                and arguably compasses. And China had more free enterprise
                during the Song dynasty than anywhere in the world. Some argue
                that China couldn’t have free enterprise because they had a long
                history of trying to impose monopolies on items like salt and
                iron. And that’s true, but when it comes to enforcing those
                monopolies, they also had a long history of failure. So really,
                in a lot of ways, China was at least as primed for an Industrial
                Revolution as Britain was.
              </p>
              <h3>Coal and Wages</h3>
              <p>
                So, why didn’t it happen? Well, Europeans-specifically the
                British had two huge advantages: First, Coal. When you trace the
                story of improved transportation, or communication, or
                industrial efficiency, or better chemical manufacturing, it
                always comes back to coal, because the Industrial Revolution was
                all about using different forms of energy to automate
                production.
              </p>
              <p>
                And England had large supplies of coal that were near the
                surface, which meant that it was cheap to mine, so it quickly
                replaced wood for heating and cooking and stuff. So that
                encouraged the British to look for more coal. The only problem
                with coal mining, aside from it being deadly, is that the coal
                mines flooded all the time.
              </p>
              <p>
                But, because there was all this incentive to get more coal out
                of the ground, steam engines were invented to pump water out of
                the mines. And because those early steam engines were super
                inefficient, they needed a cheap and abundant source of fuel in
                order to work - namely, coal, which meant they were much more
                useful to the British than anyone else. So, steam engines used
                cheap British coal to keep British coal cheap, and cheap British
                coal created the opportunity for everything from railroads to
                steel, which like so much else in the Industrial Revolution,
                created a positive feedback loop. Because they run on rails,
                railroads need steel. And because it is rather heavy, steel
                needs railroads.
              </p>
              <p>
                Secondly, there were Wages. Britain had the highest wages in the
                world at the beginning of the 18th century. In 1725, wages in
                London were the equivalent of 11 grams of silver per day. In
                Amsterdam, they were 9 grams. In Beijing, Venice, and Florence,
                they were under 4. And in Delhi, they were under 2.
              </p>
              <p>
                It’s not totally clear why wages were so high in Britain. One
                argument is that the Black Death lowered population so much that
                it tightened labor markets, but that doesn’t explain why wages
                remained low in, like, plague-ravaged Italy. Mainly, high wages
                combined with cheap fuel costs meant that it was economically
                efficient for manufacturers to look to machines as a way of
                lowering their production costs.
              </p>
              <h3>India and Cotton</h3>
              <p>
                The fact of coal being near the surface in Britain can’t be
                chalked up to British cultural superiority. But the wages
                question is a little different because it makes it sound like
                only Europeans were smart enough to pay high wages.
              </p>
              <p>
                But here’s one last thing to consider: India was the world’s
                largest producer of cotton textiles, despite paying basically
                the lowest wages in the world. Indian agriculture was so
                productive that laborers could be supported at a very low cost.
                And that, coupled with a large population, meant that Indian
                textile manufacturing could be very productive without using
                machines, so India didn’t felt the need to industrialize.
              </p>
              <p>
                But more importantly, there’s a strong argument to be made that
                Indian cotton production helped spur British industrialization.
                It was cotton textiles that drove the early Industrial
                Revolution, and the main reason that Britain was so eager to
                produce cottons was that demand was incredibly high. They were
                more comfortable than woolens, but they were also cheaper,
                because cottons could be imported from India at such a low cost.
              </p>
              <p>
                So, Indian cottons created the market and then British
                manufacturers invested in machines to increase production so
                that they could compete with India. And that’s at least one way
                in which European industrialization was truly a world
                phenomenon.
