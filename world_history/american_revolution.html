              <h1 class="title">American Revolution</h1>
              <p>
                The American Revolution was an ideological and political
                revolution that occurred in colonial North America between 1765
                and 1783. The Americans in the Thirteen Colonies defeated the
                British in the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783), gaining
                independence from the British Crown and establishing the United
                States of America, the first modern constitutional liberal
                democracy.
              </p>
              <h2>Background</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                Christopher Columbus landed in Central America in October 1492
                and went on a huge theft and murder spree. He stole gold,
                jewelry and returned europe to show off all of his riches
                including a few previously undiscovered items, such as tobacco,
                the pineapple, turkeys etc. And suddenly the race was on to
                explore and conquer the New World. After a couple centuries of
                warring with the natives and each other, the European powers had
                claimed quite a lot of land. The 17th and 18th centuries saw a
                bunch of wars between the european powers, the famous of which
                was called the
                <b>Seven Years War</b> between the British and the French, that
                began in 1756 and ended in 1763. Britain won the war and France
                gave up all of its territories in North America.
              </p>
              <p>
                But Britain's victory came at a cost. A £60 million cost. They
                were now broke, in a lot of debt, and had to come up with some
                way to repay it. So Britain decided to tax its american
                colonies. In 1764, Britain introduced the Sugar Act, forcing the
                colonists to import sugar and molasses exclusively from the
                British, and to pay duties on them. Then, a year later, they
                introduced the extremely controversial <b>Stamp Act</b> (1765),
                whereby British government was like, “Hey, since we went into
                this debt to get you all this new land, we trust that you won't
                mind if we pass the Stamp Act, in which we place a fancy stamp
                on your documents, newspapers, playing cards, etc., and in
                return, you give us money.”
              </p>
              <p>
                Well, it turns out the colonists weren't so keen on this, not so
                much because the tax was high because they had no direct
                representation in the parliament that had levied the tax. And
                plus, they were cranky about the Crown keeping large numbers of
                British troops in the colonies even after the end of the 7 Years
                War. So they protested. Orators gave fiery speeches. British
                goods were boycotted and anyone loyal to the British found
                themselves increasingly harassed. The whole thing actually began
                to take quite a toll on British business and after just a couple
                years the British were forced to repeal the Stamp Act.
              </p>
              <p>
                Again in 1766 the British levied a whole bunch of new taxes
                (Townshend Acts) on the Americans via import duties on items
                like glass, lead, paper, tea, oil etc. Once again, the Americans
                boycotted British goods, and the British had to back down. They
                repealed taxes on all items except tea.
              </p>
              <p>
                The protests escalated: 1770 saw the Boston Massacre wherein
                five civilians were killed. On December 16th, 1773 a band of
                patriots known as the Sons of Liberty disguised themselves as
                Native Americans, marched down to Boston Harbor. Boarded a
                British merchant ship loaded with tea. And in front of thousand
                spectators, threw nearly 10,000 pounds worth of tea overboard.
                The British punished Massachusetts with a vengeance. They
                dissolved its General Assembly, revoked their charter, and sent
                3,000 more troops to occupy the city. Meaning Boston and
                Massachusetts were now essentially under the direct rule of
                Great Britain.
              </p>
              <p>
                The other colonies saw what was happening, and worried they
                might be next. So they called a meeting to decide what to do.
                Fifty-six delegates from 12 colonies gathered and met in
                Philadelphia at the First <b>Continental Congress</b> which
                included America's fienst thinkers of the time including
                experienced military commander; George Washington. Soon name
                like James Madison, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson and much
                later Alexander Hamilton would all serve in the Continental
                Congress. The question now though, was what to do about the
                British. After much bitter debate and disagreement, they
                eventually agreed on simply asking the British to stop. Which
                didn't worked. They asked the local militias to start arming and
                be ready at a minutes notice. Across the colonies, these
                Minutemen stood ready for the beginning of the American
                Revolutionary War. Opponents of Britain were known as
                <b>Patriots</b>, while colonists who retained their allegiance
                to the Crown were known as <b>Loyalists</b>.
              </p>

                The Continental Congress is most famous for drafting and
                approving the Declaration of Independence: <br />
                <b
                  >"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are
                  created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with
                  certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty

              <h2>The Revolution</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                Open warfare erupted when British regulars sent to capture a
                cache of military supplies were confronted by local Patriot
                militia at Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775. Patriot
                militia, joined by the newly formed
                <b>Continental Army</b> under the leadership of George
                Washington (Commander-in-Chief), then put British forces in
                Boston under siege.
              </p>
              <p>
                Each colony formed a Provincial Congress, which assumed power
                from the former colonial governments, suppressed Loyalism, and
                contributed to the Continental Army led by General George
                Washington. The Continental Congress declared King George III of
                Britain, a tyrant who trampled the colonists' rights as
                Englishmen, and they declared the colonies free and independent
                states on July 4, 1776. The Patriot leadership professed the
                political philosophies of liberalism and republicanism to reject
                rule by monarchy and aristocracy, and they proclaimed that all
                men are created equal.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Patriots unsuccessfully attempted to invade Quebec (Canada)
                during the winter of 1775–76. The newly created Continental Army
                forced the British military out of Boston in March 1776, but the
                British captured New York City and its strategic harbor that
                summer, which they held for the duration of the war. The Royal
                Navy blockaded ports and captured other cities for brief
                periods, but they failed to destroy Washington's forces. The
                Continental Army captured a British army at the Battle of
                Saratoga in October 1777, and France then entered the war as an
                ally of the United States, transforming the war into a global
                conflict.
              </p>
              <p>
                Britain also attempted to hold the Southern states with the
                anticipated aid of Loyalists, and the war moved south. British
                general Charles Cornwallis captured an American army at
                Charleston, South Carolina in early 1780, but he failed to
                enlist enough volunteers from Loyalist civilians to take
                effective control of the territory. Finally, a combined American
                and French force captured Cornwallis' army at Yorktown in the
                fall of 1781, effectively ending the war.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Treaty of Paris was signed on September 3, 1783, formally
                ending the conflict and confirming the new nation's complete
                separation from the British Empire. The United States took
                possession of nearly all the territory east of the Mississippi
                River and south of the Great Lakes, with the British retaining
                control of northern Canada, and Spain taking Florida.
              </p>
              <h2>Conclusion</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                While we generally see the Revolution as a step toward justice
                and equality, the people who most needed the protection of a
                government might have been better off and more free, if Britain
                had won. Especially since Britain ended slavery well before
                America did, and that too without a civil war.
              </p>
              <p>
                So, here's what was pretty revolutionary about the American
                Revolution: The colonists threw off the rule of an imperial
                monarchy and replaced it with a government that didn't have a
                king, a radical idea in a world that didn't feature many
                non-monarchical forms of government.
