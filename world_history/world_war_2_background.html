              <h1 class="title">World War 2 - Background</h1>

              <p>
                World War I had radically altered the political European map,
                with the defeat of the Central Powers—including Austria-Hungary,
                Germany, Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire and the 1917 Bolshevik
                seizure of power in Russia, which led to the founding of the
                Soviet Union.
              </p>
              <p>
                Meanwhile, the victorious Allies of World War I, such as France,
                Belgium, Italy, Romania, and Greece, gained territory, and new
                nation-states were created out of the collapse of
                Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman and Russian Empires.
              </p>
              <p>
                To prevent a future world war, the <b>League of Nations</b> was
                created during the 1919 Paris Peace Conference. Despite strong
                pacifist sentiment after World War I, irredentist and revanchist
                nationalism emerged in several European states in the same
                period.
              </p>
              <h2>Germany under Hitler</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <h3>Early Life</h3>
              <p>
                Adolf Hitler had a troubled upbringing. Right from his
                childhood, he got big into German nationalism. He dropped out of
                school but he was an Incredible Speaker.
              </p>
              <p>
                By his 20s, both his parents were dead. He went to Vienna
                (Austria) hoping to find a career in the arts. Instead without
                parental support, hitler ended up on the streets. He spent a few
                rough years living in and out of homeless shelters, making what
                little he could from selling postcards he painted.
              </p>
              <p>
                During his time in Austria, he became a firm believer in the
                idea that there are many Races, the purest of which were the
                German aryan people and the worst of which he believed were
                jews. His anti-semitic beliefs originated here.
              </p>
              <p>
                Since Austria-Hungary was a multi-ethnic Empire full of lesser
                races according to hitler, he moved to Munich in Germany at 24
                years of age and for one more year he was a drifter on the
                streets.
              </p>
              <h3>World War I and Aftermath</h3>
              <p>
                When the World war 1 started, Hitler volunteered for the German
                Army. He was reportedly a brave soldier and was awarded the iron
                cross. He had many close encounters with death. He was blinded
                by a british gas attack in 1918. A month later still recovering
                in hospital, he learned of Germany's defeat and Surrender.
              </p>
              <p>
                The conditions of <b>Treaty of Versailles</b> wreaked havoc in
                Germany. They lost territory, had to demilitarise the Rhineland
                (western Germany), had to reduce their army to just 100,000 men,
                couldn't have an airforce, had to pay the Allies a huge amount
                of money that it didn't have.
              </p>
              <p>
                Hitler, seeing his country humiliated grew hatred in him for
                those responsible, who according to him were the communists and
                jews. He believed that they had stabbed Germany in the back by
                spreading dissent and Anti War Propaganda.
              </p>
              <p>
                The German Empire was dissolved in the German Revolution of
                1918–1919, and a democratic government, later known as the
                <b>Weimar Republic</b>, was created which lasted till 1933.
              </p>
              <h3>Entry into politics</h3>
              <p>
                Since Germany's military had to be reduced, Hitler could no
                longer remain a soldier after the war, but he kept working for
                the army as an informant. After the war, communists in Germany
                had attempted a revolution, and the government was worried about
                communism in general, so Hitler was tasked with infiltrating and
                reporting on any new political parties that could pose a
                communist threat.
              </p>
              <p>
                One time he infiltrated into the
                <b>German Workers' Party</b> but found out that they weren't
                communists at all - they were extreme right, and shared many of
                his extreme beliefs, so he left the army, and signed up to join
                the party. His fantastic speaking abilities impressed the
                party's leadership and supporters, and he very quickly rose to
                the top. He renamed the party to the
                <b>National Socialist German Workers' Party</b>, or Nazi for
                short, and adopted the Swastika as its symbol.
              </p>
              <p>
                Hitler gave a new direction to the party by promising to return
                Germany to it's former glory by undoing the Treaty of
                Versailles, and reuniting all ethic Germans into one nation. He
                also said that only pure Aryan people should be allowed to be
                citizens and that all Jews would lose their citizenship.
              </p>
              <p>
                Many of the political parties in Germany at the time had
                para-military wings, and the Nazis were no different. Hitler set
                up the "Storm Detachment" (Sturmabteilung), or SA for short.
                Their job was to defend Nazi party meetings and intimidate
                political opponents, and they were frequently engaged in battles
                with communists on the streets.
              </p>
              <h3>Rise to power</h3>
              <p>
                The new democratic government (Weimar Republic) was pretty weak
                and ineffective. In order to pay reparations to the Allies, it
                started printing more money. The problem is that printing money
                doesn't actually give a country more money - it just makes money
                less valuable (Inflation). So as the country printed more and
                more money, it became worth less and less and the currency
                crashed. Banknotes became worthless.
              </p>
              <p>
                In such an economic crisis, Germany struggled to pay the allies.
                France occupied the Ruhr, an area full of factories, and took
                the economic output from the area as payment. They treated the
                German civilians badly and many Germans were killed during the
                occupation.
              </p>
              <p>
                Germans were furious and Hitler and the Nazis thought that now
                would be a great time to lead a revolution. He made an
                unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the German government in 1923.
                Even though the attempt failed, his popularity rose.
              </p>
              <p>
                To help Germany pay its reparations, America agreed to give it
                loans. In October 1929, the Wall Street crash happened that
                started the <b>Great Depression</b>. America wanted its money
                back. The economic strain that stood on an already struggling
                Germany was severe. Unemployment skyrocketed, Poverty was
                widespread .
              </p>
              <p>
                It was clear that the newly formed democracy wasn't working. In
                the face of crisis, Germans began moving to the political
                extremes i.e., either the communists or the Nazis. The Nazi
                party used propaganda to make Hitler seem like a great and
                powerful man and they became more and more popular until in
                1932, they became the biggest party in the German parliament.
              </p>
              <h3>Appointment as chancellor and then the Dictator</h3>
              <p>
                Hitler ran for president but lost to the extremely popular World
                War I general, <b>Paul von Hindenburg</b>. Since he was now the
                leader of the biggest party, though, he demanded President
                Hindenburg make him chancellor, to which he agreed reluctantly.
              </p>
              <p>
                Hitler became chancellor of Germany in January 1933, but he was
                not yet a dictator. In February, the German Parliament building
                was set on fire. Historians still aren't sure who did it and
                many suspect the Nazis did it themselves, but Hitler blamed the
                communists, and he convinced president Hindenburg to sign an
                emergency decree allowing him to imprison all communists and
                other political opponents.
              </p>
              <h3>Dictatorship</h3>
              <p>
                Communists and others were sent off to the first concentration
                camp in Dachau. At this time, the elderly president Hindenburg
                passed away, giving Hitler the perfect opportunity. He
                introduced a law to parliament that would allow him to make all
                future laws and decisions entirely on his own. Just two months
                after becoming chancellor, Hitler was now a dictator.
              </p>
              <p>
                He still had one problem. The leader of the SA, Rohm wanted the
                SA to take over the job of the regular German Army and the
                German Army didn't like that idea. Hitler needed to maintain the
                support of his professionally trained German army, more so than
                his rough and rowdy SA.
              </p>
              <p>
                So one night in June 1934, he had Rohm and many other of his own
                SA officers rounded up and murdered. While he was at it, he took
                the opportunity to brutally settle some personal scores as well.
                Politicians who had disagreed with him in the past, reporters
                who had printed negative articles about him and in some cases,
                even their families were murdered. In total, up to 200 people
                were killed in what became known as the
                <b>Night of the Long Knives</b>.
              </p>
              <p>
                The army, now satisfied that they wouldn't be replaced, pledged
                total allegiance to their new fuhrer and Hitler's control was
                now absolute.
              </p>
              <h3>Life in Nazi Germany</h3>
              <p>
                Life in Germany changed violently. Freedom of the press,
                expression, and public assembly were suspended. Jews were
                initially branded and their businesses boycotted, and
                eventually, Hitler would go on to have six million Jewish men,
                women, and children killed in concentration camps. Hundreds of
                thousands of people were forced into sterilization for physical
                and mental imperfections.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Hitler Youth</b> an youth organisation of the Nazi Party was
                formed to brainwash the young. Boys were trained to fight and
                returned home from camp, violent. Girls were told their purpose
                was to have many pure Aryan children and they would sometimes
                return from camp, pregnant. When their parents were
                understandably horrified, their children would threaten to turn
                them over to the Gestapo (secret police) for standing in the way
                of Germany's greatness.
              </p>
              <p>
                Anyone who dared to pose Hitler or speak out against him in any
                way, would be sent to a concentration camp.
              </p>
              <h3>Why Hitler Went to War?</h3>
              <p>
                Hitler had a number of reasons for wanting to expand Germany’s
                territory, but he often talked about <b>Lebensraum</b> or living
                space for the German people. German agriculture was
                inefficiently organized into lots of small farms, and that meant
                that Germany needed a lot of land in order to be self-sufficient
                in food production.
              </p>
              <p>
                His plan was to take Poland, the Ukraine, and Eastern Russia,
                and then resettle that land with lots of Germans, so that it
                could feed German people. This was called the
                <b>Hunger Plan</b> because the plan called for 20 million people
                to starve to death. Many would be the Poles, Ukrainians, and
                Russians who’d previously lived on the land. The rest would be
                Europe’s Jews, who would be worked to death.

              </p>
              <p>
                German Nationalism captivated the young Adolf. Extreme ideology
                and anti-semitism vested in him as a young man living a hard
                life on the streets. Germany's defeat in the First World War
                filled him with hatred and a thirst for vengeance. A political
                movement that treated him like a god and hundreds of thousands
                looking up to him as their savior made him a megalomaniac, and
                soon, his aggressive foreign policies would drag the world into
                a second tragic global conflict, otherwise known as World War
                II.

              <h2>Italy and Benito Mussolini</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                Mussolini was originally a socialist politician and a
                journalist. He later denounced socialism for extreme nationalism
                also called <b>Fascism</b>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Fascism is a form of far-right, authoritarian ultra-nationalism
                characterized by dictatorial power, forcible suppression of
                opposition, and strong regimentation of society and of the
                economy.
              </p>
              <p>
                Mussolini's aim was to restore the ancient glory of the Roman
                Empire by expanding Italian colonial possessions and reunite all
                Italian peoples.
              </p>

              <h3>World War 1 and Italy</h3>
              <p>
                Italy joined on the side of Allied Powers during world war 1,
                since it was promised a part of Austria-Hungary's land by the
                Allies. After the war, the refusal of the Allies to grant these
                promised territories caused widespread indignation among Italian
                nationalists.
              </p>
              <p>
                On top of that, a bad economy, high unemployment and weak
                governments meant that the Italian people were unhappy. Post-War
                period was characterized by mass strikes and unrests.
              </p>
              <h3>Rise of Mussolini</h3>
              <p>
                Tired of Instable governments, Mussolini's fascist movement
                gained a lot of support. Mussolini was appointed prime minister
                in 1922 by King Victor Emmanuel III. After removing all
                political opposition through his secret police and outlawing
                labor strikes, Mussolini and his followers consolidated power
                through a series of laws that transformed the nation into a
                <b>one-party dictatorship</b>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Within five years, Mussolini had established dictatorial
                authority by both legal and illegal means and aspired to create
                a totalitarian state.
              </p>
              <p>
                Hitler and Mussolini had a lot of the same ideas and beliefs,
                both were radical nationalists, anti-democratic, anti-socialist,
                both envisioned a totalitarian regime with them at center, both
                had superiority complex and most importantly both had same
                enemies.
              </p>
              <p>
                With the Outbreak of World War 2, Italy alienated itself from
                Britain and France by aligning with Germany and Japan.
              </p>

              <h2>Japan</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                Japan at the start of 20th century, was suffering from an acute
                fear of food shortage because its agricultural sector was having
                trouble keeping up with population growth. And the Japanese too,
                sought to expand their agricultural holdings by, for instance,
                resettling farmers in Korea. So, they fought with Russia in
                1904-1905 and surprisingly won. Then they fully annexed Korea.
              </p>
              <p>
                Japan joined the World War 1 on the side of Allied Powers
                primarily to capture German Islands and colonies in East Asia.
              </p>
              <p>
                Then there was an incident (that maybe staged by the Japanese
                army) known as the Mukden Incident (1931) where a bomb blew up a
                Japanese train in Manchuria (in China), giving them an excuse to
                launch an invasion and take over Manchuria.
