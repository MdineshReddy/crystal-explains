              <h1 class="title">World War 1</h1>
              <p>
                World War I, also known as the <b>Great War</b> or the first
                total war or the <b>war to end all wars</b>, began in 1914 with
                the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria and
                lasted until 1918.
              </p>
              <p>
                During the conflict, the great powers of Europe were divided
                into two coalitions:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Great Britain, France, Russia, Belgium, Italy, Serbia,
                  Romania, Japan and the United States (from 1917) etc., which
                  were called the <b>Allied Powers</b> and
                </li>
                <li>
                  Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire
                  etc., which were called the <b>Central Powers</b> .
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h2>Background</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                For much of the 19th century, the major European powers had
                tried to maintain a tenuous balance of power among themselves,
                resulting in a complex network of political and military
                alliances.
              </p>
              <h3>The Spark: Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand</h3>
              <p>
                On 28 June 1914, <b>Archduke Franz Ferdinand</b>, heir to the
                Austro-Hungarian Empire, visited the <b>Sarajevo</b>, the then
                part of Austria-Hungary with Serbian and Bosnian population who
                were not happy with Austria-Hungary annexing the Southern
                provinces.
              </p>
              <p>
                A group of bosnian-serb assassins gathered on the street where
                the Archduke's motorcade was to pass, with the intention of
                assassinating him. They threw a grenade at the car but missed.
                Some nearby were injured by the blast, but Ferdinand's convoy
                carried on.
              </p>
              <p>
                About an hour later, when Ferdinand was returning from a visit
                at the Sarajevo Hospital with those wounded in the assassination
                attempt, the convoy took a wrong turn into a street where, by
                coincidence, <b>Gavrilo Princip</b>, one of the assassin stood.
                With a pistol, Princip shot and killed Ferdinand and his wife
                Sophie.
              </p>
              <p>
                The assassination led Austria to issue
                <b>July Ultimatum</b>, a series of ten demands that were made
                intentionally unacceptable, in an effort to provoke a war with
                Serbia. Serbia accepted all the terms of the ultimatum except
                for articles five and six, which demanded that
                Austrian-Hungarian representatives be allowed to assist in
                suppressing subversive elements inside Serbia's borders and to
                participate in the investigation and trial of Serbians linked to
                the assassination.
              </p>
              <p>
                With Serbia not accepting all the demands, Austria broke off
                diplomatic relations with Serbia and on 28 July 1914, a month
                after the assassination, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia.
              </p>
              <h2>The War Begins</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                Russia under <b>Tsar Nicolas II</b>, due to its alliance with
                the Serbs, mobilized its army against Austria-Hungary.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Kaiser Wilhelm II</b> the emperor of Germany asked his
                cousin, Tsar Nicolas II, to suspend the Russian mobilisation,
                which Russia failed to do, so then Germany mobilized its own
                army and declared war on Russia.
              </p>
              <p>
                The German government issued demands to France that it remain
                neutral. the French did not respond but sent a mixed message by
                ordering their troops to withdraw 10 km from the border to avoid
                any incidents, and at the same time ordered the mobilisation of
                their reserves. Germany declared war on France.
              </p>
              <p>
                Germany’s War plan, the <b>Schlieffen Plan</b>, required that it
                invade France via neutral Belgium, And Great Britain was a
                friend of Belgium and so they declared war on Germany.
              </p>
              <p>
                Within a week, Russia, Belgium, France, Great Britain and Serbia
                had lined up against Austria-Hungary and Germany, and World War
                I had begun.
              </p>
              <h3>The War</h3>
              <p>
                According to Schlieffen Plan, Germany was to quickly knock
                France and Britain out of the war on the western front, then
                redeploy to the Eastern front and do the same to Russia.
              </p>
              <p>
                The initial German advance in the West was very successful: by
                the end of August the left Allied forces (France & Britain) were
                in full retreat by the <b>Battle of the Frontiers</b> .
              </p>
              <p>
                But Russia is ready for war, way earlier than expected. Germany
                had to send some troops back to the east to defend against the
                Russians, contributing to the German loss in the Battle of the
                Marne.
              </p>
              <p>
                Austria-Hungary was fighting both Serbia and Russia at the same
                time.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>First Battle of the Marne</b>: A gap opened up between the
                German armies as they closed in on Paris. If a gap opens up, the
                opponents can use it to flank from the sides and behind. This
                made German forces retreat back some 50 km. The allies launch a
                counter attack. The Germans dig into defensive position. The
                allies did the same. This started the <b> trench warfare</b>.
              </p>
              <div class="note">
                <h3 style="text-align: center">trench warfare</h3>
                <p>
                  The trench warfare on the Western Front is most famous for its
                  brutal futility. Great Britain and France on one side, Germany
                  on the other, with no man’s land (a muddy land of shell
                  craters and barbed wire) between.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One side would pummel the other with endless barrage of
                  artillery shells. This had a huge psychological effect on the
                  soldier, leaving many shell shocked.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Sometimes, the attackers would leave their trenches and rush
                  across no man's land. The defending side would then unleash
                  machine gun fire on the attackers inflicting thousands of
                  casualties. The attacking side would send wave after wave,
                  until either they gave up or the defending trench was finally
                  overrun.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There would be months of fighting and the deaths of thousands
                  in order to gain a few meters or kilometers of land.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Living in the trenches was hard too. Corpses, mud that could
                  swallow you whole, pools of poisonous water, rats, disease,
                  the smell of decomposing bodies. World War I was a writer’s
                  war, and there’s a lot of metaphorical resonance in living men
                  digging holes where they would in time die.
                </p>
                <p>
                  And for most soldiers, especially the British and French, the
                  pay for their efforts was pitiful. So why did they even keep
                  fighting? Duty, nationalism, loyalty to comrades, and fear of
                  being shot for desertion all played a role.
                </p>
              </div>
              <h3>New Frontiers and Participants</h3>
              <p>
                When the war first broke out Australia was quick to take German
                New Guinea. The Allies also quickly invaded Germany's colonies
                in Africa, and particularly in German East Africa, locals were
                enlisted as soldiers and carriers by both sides. Leading to a
                tragic loss of life for the Native Africans.
              </p>
              <p>
                Italy, Romania and Japan joined the war on the side of Allied
                Powers. Japan captured German Islands and colonies in East Asia.
                Italy was promised a part of Austria-Hungary's land by the
                Allies. Romania also joined the Allied Powers in 1916, only to
                be defeated in 1917.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Ottomans joined the Central Powers in the middle East.
                First, the Ottomans tried to attack Russia in the Caucasus
                Mountains. But they weren't prepared for the cold and many of
                them froze to death. Then they crossed miles of desert to take
                the Suez Canal from the British. But that failed, too. Then the
                Allies tried to take the Dardanelles (the strait linking the Sea
                of Marmara with the Aegean Sea) at Gallipoli in a long and hard
                trench warfare campaign but that also failed. The Ottomans
                blamed their initial losses on the ethnic Armenians living
                within Ottoman territory. And the resulting Armenian genocide
                led to the deaths of one and a half million people.
              </p>
              <p>
                Bulgaria joined the Central Powers as the Central Powers
                promised land to it.
              </p>
              <div class="note">
                <h3 style="text-align: center">India and the World War 1</h3>
                <p>
                  British feared that Indian nationalist would start instigating
                  uprisings in India in the backdrop of world war 1. However,
                  contrary to British fears of a revolt in India, the outbreak
                  of the war saw an unprecedented outpouring of loyalty and
                  goodwill towards Britain. Indian political leaders were eager
                  to support the British war effort since they believed that
                  strong support for the war effort would further the cause of
                  Indian Home Rule. India supplied men, food, clothes, and
                  ammunition. The suffering caused by the war, as well as the
                  failure of the British government to grant self-government to
                  India after the end of the war, fuelled the campaign for full
                  independence that would be led by Gandhi and others.
                </p>
              </div>
              <p>
                All these new Frontiers hadn't done much to change the war.
                Aware that the Allies had more men and supplies than them, the
                Germans knew they had to do something to break the stalemate.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Germans (violating the Hague Convention that banned chemical
                warfare and attacks on civilians) used chlorine gas for the
                first time in the <b>Second Battle of Ypres</b> (2 Apr 1915) on
                the Western Front. Several types of gas soon became widely used
                by both sides and became one of the most-feared and
                best-remembered horrors of the war. The Germans also started
                Zeppelin air raids over British cities and they used submarines
                to sink civilian ships. One such civilian ship was the
                <b>Lusitania</b> which had a Americans on board when it was
                sunk. Further swaying US opinion against the Germans.
              </p>

              <p>
                <b>Battles of Verdun (1916) and Somme (1916):</b> The longest
                and one of the bloodiest battles of the war started when the
                Germans launched an attack around the French city of Verdun. The
                French defended it desperately, leading to hundreds of thousands
                of casualties. Under pressure, the French called on its allies
                to draw the German's attention away. So, the British started
                their own long and brutal fight, the Battle of the Somne, with
                60,000 British casualties on just the first day. Tanks were
                developed by Britain and France and were first used in combat by
                the British.

                In the Middle East, Russia was pushing into Ottoman territory
                from the North. A new offensive under one famous British
                officer, better known as <b>Lawrence of Arabia</b> was launched
                from the south with all-out desert warfare. He helped to lead
                the Arab tribes in a revolt that wreaked Havoc on the Ottoman
                supply lines.

                By the time 1917 rolled around everyone was exhausted. There are
                mutinies in the French army, the German populace was starving,
                and the war had drained all of Russia's supplies. There is no
                clear winner, and it was still anyone's war.

                The Russia was first to break. Tired of food shortages, there
                was an uprising in Petrograd complete with riots and strikes.
                The riots turned into a full-scale revolution (<a href='/world_history/russian_revolution.html'>read more on Russian Revolution</a
                >) and a new government overthrew the Tsar. Then a few months
                later the Bolsheviks overthrew the new government. And they
                pulled Russia out of the war by signing
                <b>Treaty of Brest-Litovsk</b> on 3 March 1918. The treaty ceded
                vast territories, including Finland, the Baltic provinces, parts
                of Poland and Ukraine to the Central Powers

                At the outbreak of the war, the United States pursued a policy
                of non-intervention: avoiding conflict while trying to broker
                peace. When the German U-boat sank the British liner RMS
                Lusitania on 7 May 1915 with 128 Americans among the dead,
                President <b>Woodrow Wilson</b> demanded an end to attacks on
                passenger ships. Germany complied. Wilson unsuccessfully tried
                to mediate a settlement. In January 1917, Germany invited Mexico
                to join the war as its ally against the US. In return, the
                Germans would finance Mexico's war and help it recover the
                territories of Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona. But the British
                intercepted the message, showed it to the Americans, and that
                was the final straw and Wilson declared war on Germany. American
                troops began shipping out to Europe.

              <p>
                This was terrible news for Germany. And they knew their only
                hope now is to force France and the UK to surrender before the
                fresh American troops arrived. It was now or never. So they
                started one final attack. They converged their troops and hit
                hard at the Somme and pushed the Allies back. They hit a second
                time for the north, then again, and again.
              </p>
              <p>
                With each hit the germans were spending more and more resources
                while the allies were getting better and better at repelling
                their attacks. With American troops now arriving in larger
                numbers the Allies launched a counter-attack, and that was it.

                The central powers were being pushed back on all fronts.
                Bulgaria collapsed first, followed by the Ottoman Empire, then
                Austria-Hungary and finally on November 11th, 1918 at 11
                o'clock, Germany surrendered.

                To prevent a future world war, the <b>League of Nations</b> was
                created during the 1919 Paris Peace Conference. The
                organisation's primary goals were to prevent armed conflict
                through collective security, military and naval disarmament, and
                settling international disputes through peaceful negotiations
                and arbitration.

              <h2>Conclusion</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                Most people think of World War I as a tragedy because it didn’t
                need to happen and didn’t really accomplish much, except for
                creating social and economic conditions that made World War II
                possible.
              </p>
              <p>
                The war itself was incredibly destructive. Over 15 million
                people were killed and over 20 million wounded. A lot of
                civilians died, especially in the Ottoman Empire where more than
                2 million of the 3 million people killed were non-combatants.
                Armenian Genocide by Ottomans which killed 1.5 million Armenians
                took place in 1915.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another major outcome of the war was the end of the Ottoman
                Empire and the emergence of the nation-state of Turkey. The rest
                of the world saw some change too, but not much for the better.
                In Africa, Britain took Germany’s colonies, and even though
                Indians fought and died in a higher percentage, India didn’t
                gain any real autonomy.
              </p>

              <p>
                All these terrible outcomes led to a general sense of
                disappointment in literary circles, and this feeling of
                pointlessness and cynicism was expressed by the writers of the
                <b>“lost generation.”</b> It was a war full of loss: Millions of
                people were lost. Traditional ideals of war’s nobility and
                heroism were lost as well. What is heroism when you’re just
                sitting in a trench, waiting to be blown up?
              </p>
              <p>
                One silver lining in all of this tragedy can be the experiences
                of the soldiers from India, Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and
                Canada that helped build nationalist movements when survivors
                returned home after the war.
