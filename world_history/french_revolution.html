              <h1 class="title">French Revolution (1789-1799)</h1>
              <p>
                The French Revolution was a watershed event in modern European
                history that began in 1789 and ended in the late 1790s with the
                ascent of Napoleon Bonaparte. The Revolution was caused by
                widespread discontent with the French monarchy and the poor
                economic policies of King Louis XVI.
              </p>

              <h2>Background</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                France in the start of the 18th century was a rich and populous
                country, but it had a systemic problem collecting taxes because
                of the way its society was structured.
              </p>
              <p>
                French society in the eighteenth century followed a political
                and social system called <b>'Ancien Regime'</b> (Old Order)
                according to which the society was divided into three estates
                with everyone being a subject to the King.
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  The First Estate included the Clergy, i.e., the Church and its
                  members.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Second Estate included the Nobility, i.e., the rulers and
                  other feudal lords.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The third Estate included everone else, for example;
                  businessmen, merchants, lawyers, artisans, servants, peasants
                  etc. which constituted more than ninety per cent of the entire
                  population.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                Only the members of the third estate were required to pay taxes.
                This was bad because the people with the money -the nobles and
                the clergy - never paid taxes.
              </p>
              <p>
                By 1789, France was deeply in debt thanks to their funding the
                American Revolution that helped thirteen American colonies gain
                their independence from Britain. This added more than a billion
                livres to a debt that had already risen to more than 2 billion
                livres. Lenders who gave the state credit, now began to charge
                10 per cent interest on loans. <b>King Louis XVI</b> was
                spending half of his national budget to repay the federal debt.
              </p>
              <p>
                To meet its regular expenses, such as the cost of maintaining an
                army, the court, running government offices or universities, the
                state had only one solution: tax the third estate. The state
                levied two types of taxes:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>a direct tax, called <b>taille</b> and</li>
                <li>
                  a number of indirect taxes which were levied on articles of
                  everyday consumption like salt or tobacco.
                </li>
              </ol>

              <p>
                There's also
                <b>labour tax</b> where peasants were required to work a certain
                number of days for their local lord without pay. The Church too
                extracted its share of taxes called <b>tithes</b> from the
                peasants.
              </p>
              <p>
                This unfortunately coincided with hailstorms that ruined a
                year’s harvest, thereby raising food prices and causing
                widespread hunger and a <b>subsistence crisis</b>. Meanwhile,
                the King and his wife <b>Marie Antoinette</b> (an Austrian
                princess) led an extravagant lifestyle in the palace of
                Versailles. The upper classes had massive stocks of grain, wheat
                etc. So they were virtually untouched by this crisis.

                  <b>The Emergence of an Intellectual Middle Class</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The eighteenth century france witnessed the emergence of
                  social groups, termed the middle class, which included rich
                  businessmen, manufacturers, lawyers and administrative
                  officials. Most of them were educated and believed that no
                  group in society should be privileged by birth. Rather, a
                  person’s social position must depend on his merit.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These ideas envisaging a society based on freedom and equal
                  laws and opportunities for all, were put forward by
                  philosophers such as <b>John Locke</b> and
                  <b>Jean Jacques Rousseau</b> .
                </p>

                    John Locke in his <b><i>Two Treatises of Government</i></b
                    >, sought to refute the doctrine of the divine and absolute
                    right
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Jean Jacques Rousseau proposed a form of government based on
                    a social contract between people and their representatives.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Montesquieu in his <b><i>The Spirit of Laws</i></b
                    >, proposed a division of power within the government
                    between the legislative, the executive and the judiciary,
                    which was received well in both Great Britain and the
                    American colonies.

              <h2>The Outbreak of the Revolution</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                Basically, the peasants were hungry and started rioting, the
                intellectuals were questioning the unjust and unequal treatment,
                and the nobility were failing to make any meaningful financial
                reform.
              </p>
              <p>
                In response to the crisis, Louis XVI called a meeting of the
                <b>Estates General</b> which hadn’t met since 1614. The Estates
                General was like a parliament (but merely an advisory body) made
                up of representatives from the First Estate, the clergy, the
                Second Estate, the nobility, and the Third Estate, everyone
                else.
              </p>
              <p>
                On 5 May 1789, the assembly of the Estates General took place to
                find an amicable solution to the ongoing crisis. A resplendent
                hall in Versailles was prepared to host the delegates. The Third
                Estate showed up with about 600 representatives, the First and
                Second Estates both had about 300. Voting in the Estates General
                was based on the principle that "each estate had one vote".
              </p>
              <p>
                The third estate knew that any reform proposed by them would be
                out-voted by the first and second estates. So, they demanded
                that voting now be conducted by the assembly as a whole, where
                each member would have one vote. When the king rejected this
                proposal, members of the third estate walked out of the assembly
                in protest and decided to form their own
                <b>National Assembly</b>.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Third Estate representatives assembled in an indoor tennis
                court where they swore the famous Tennis Court Oath (on 20th
                June 1789) pledging to not to give up until a French
                constitution was established.
              </p>
              <div class="note">
                <h3>Composition of the National Assembly</h3>
                <p>The members of the National Assembly were of two type:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    The Moderates who wanted to create a
                    <b>constitutional monarchy</b> with equal rights for
                    everyone. They believed that the king was necessary for a
                    functioning state.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The radicals who called for the
                    <b>creation of a republic</b> i.e., the removal of the King
                    altogether. The most radical wing was called
                    <b>the Jacobins</b> under the leadership of
                    <b>Maximilian Robespierre</b>. They are particularly
                    inspired by the writings of <b>Jean-Paul-Marat</b> and his
                    newspaper the 'Friend of the People'.

                </ol>
              </div>

              <p>
                While the National Assembly was busy at Versailles drafting a
                constitution, the rest of France was in turmoil. A severe winter
                caused a bad harvest; the price of bread rose, often bakers
                exploited the situation and hoarded supplies. After spending
                hours in long queues at the bakery, crowds of angry men and
                women stormed into the shops.
              </p>
              <p>
                Louis XVI responded by sending troops to Paris primarily to
                quell uprisings over food shortages, but the revolutionaries saw
                this as a provocation, so they responded by seizing the Bastille
                Prison on July 14th 1789, which was later called the
                <b>Bastille Day</b>. The Bastille was stormed to free seven
                prisoners and to get gunpowder.

                  The wave of revolutionary fervor and widespread hysteria
                  quickly swept the countryside. Revolting against years of
                  exploitation, peasants looted and burned the homes of tax
                  collectors, landlords and the elite.

                  Known as the <b>Great Fear</b>, the agrarian insurrection
                  fuelled the exodus of nobles from the country and inspired the
                  National Constituent Assembly to abolish feudalism on August
                  4, 1789, signing what the historians call the “death

                    In August of 1789, the Assembly adopted the Declaration of

                  On October of 1789, a rumor started that Marie Antoinette was
                  hoarding grain somewhere inside the palace of Versailles. In
                  what became known as the <b>Women's March</b>, a bunch of
                  armed peasant women stormed the palace and demanded that Louis
                  and Marie Antoinette move from Versailles to Paris, which they
                  did. The King also agreed to share his power with the
                  revolutionary government (i.e., the National Assembly).

                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>
                  The National Assembly completed the draft of the constitution
                  in 1791. Its main object was to limit the powers of the King
                  who was made a constitutional head. These powers instead of
                  being concentrated in the hands of one person, were now
                  separated and assigned to different institutions – the
                  legislature, executive and judiciary. This made France a
                  constitutional monarchy.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Ancient Régime was abolished - feudal rights, tithes,
                  privileges for nobles, unequal taxation were eliminated.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Constitution of 1791 vested the power to make laws in the
                  National Assembly, which was indirectly elected. That is,
                  citizens voted for a group of electors, who in turn chose the
                  Assembly. Not all citizens, however, had the right to vote.
                  Only men above 25 years of age who belonged to the highest
                  bracket of taxpayers were entitled to vote.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Constitution began with a
                  <b>Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen</b>. Rights
                  such as the right to life, freedom of speech, freedom of
                  opinion, equality before law, were established as ‘natural and
                  inalienable’ rights, that is, they belonged to each human
                  being by birth and could not be taken away. It was the duty of
                  the state to protect each citizen’s natural rights.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The radicals such as those in the Jacobian club, were outraged
                  that the new constitution did not remove the King entirely.

                <h2>France Abolishes Monarchy and Becomes a Republic</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>
                  France’s monarchical neighbors were getting nervous about
                  france becoming a republic fearing those revolutionary ideas
                  might spread to their nations. Leopold II, the emperor of
                  Austria who was also Marie Antoinette’s brother and King
                  William Frederick II of Prussia (Germany) decided to restore
                  the French monarchy.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Before that could happen, the National Assembly voted in April
                  1792 to declare war against Prussia and Austria. Thousands of
                  volunteers thronged from the provinces to join the army. They
                  saw this as a war of the people against kings and
                  aristocracies all over Europe. Among the patriotic songs they
                  sang was the
                  <b>Marseillaise</b> (composed by the poet Claude Joseph Rouget
                  de Lisle) which is now the national anthem of France.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the summer of 1792 the Jacobins planned an insurrection of
                  a large number of Parisians who were angered by the war time
                  miseries of short supplies and high prices of food. On the
                  morning of August 10 they stormed the Palace of the Tuileries
                  in Paris, massacred the king’s guards. The King and his family
                  take refuge in the Legislative Assembly.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Assembly voted to suspend the monarchy, have new elections
                  in which everyone could vote (as long as they were men), and
                  create a new republican constitution. The newly elected
                  assembly was called the <b>National Convention</b>. It
                  abolished the monarchy and declared France a republic.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Soon, the assembly had a trial for Louis XVI, who was found
                  guilty and was sentenced to die via guillotine on 21 January
                  1793. The queen Marie Antoinette met with the same fate
                  shortly after.

                  republic – ex-nobles and clergy, members of other political
                  parties, even members of his own party who did not agree with
                  his methods – were arrested, imprisoned and then tried by a
                  revolutionary tribunal. If the court found them ‘guilty’ they
                  were guillotined.

                  Robespierre pursued his policies so relentlessly that even his
                  supporters began to demand moderation. Finally, he was
                  convicted by a court in July 1794, arrested and sent to the
                  guillotine.

                  His death marked the beginning of the
                  <b>Thermidorian Reaction</b>, a moderate phase in which the
                  French people revolted against the Reign of Terror’s excesses.

                  Some historians believe that the french revolution ended with
                  the Robespierre's execution in 1794. While some believe that
                  it lasted till 1799 when Napoleonic era began.

                  After the Terror, the revolution pulled back a bit and another
                  new constitution was put into place, this one giving a lot
                  more power to wealthy people. At this point, France was still
                  at war with Austria and Britain, wars that France ended up
                  winning, largely thanks to a corporal named
                  <b>Napoleon Bonaparte</b>.

                  In November 1799, Napoleon Bonaparte engineered a coup and
                  established himself as the First Consul of France which
                  granted him almost unlimited executive power under yet another
                  constitution.

                  <p>
                    In 1804, Napoleon Bonaparte crowned himself Emperor of
                    France. He set out to conquer neighbouring European
                    countries, dispossessing dynasties and creating kingdoms
                    where he placed members of his family. Napoleon saw his role
                    as a moderniser of Europe. He introduced many laws such as
                    the protection of private property and a uniform system of
                    weights and measures provided by the decimal system.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Initially, many saw Napoleon as a liberator who would bring
                    freedom for the people. But soon the Napoleonic armies came
                    to be viewed everywhere as an invading force.

                    He was finally defeated at Waterloo in 1815 and was exiled
                    to island of Saint Helena in the Atlantic Ocean. Many of his
                    measures that carried the revolutionary ideas of liberty and
                    modern laws to other parts of Europe had an impact on people
                    long after Napoleon had left.

                <h2>Conclusion: Was French Revolution, a success?</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>
                  It's not easy to conclude that the French Revolution was a
                  success since Napoleon was basically a dictator and, in some
                  ways, he was even more of an absolute monarch than Louis XVI
                  had been. Gradually the nobles came back to France, although
                  they had mostly lost their special privileges. The Catholic
                  Church returned, too, although much weaker because it had lost
                  land and the ability to collect tithes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  And when Napoleon himself fell in 1815, France restored the
                  monarchy. Granted they were no longer absolute monarchs who
                  claimed that their right to rule came from God; they were
                  constitutional monarchs of the kind that the revolutionaries
                  of 1789 had originally envisioned. But the fact remains that
                  France had a king again, and a nobility, and an established
                  religion and it was definitely not a democracy or a republic.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But it's definitely not a Failure either, the revolution
                  succeeded in spreading enlightenment ideals and insisted on
                  the universality of these ideals. Look at Article 6 of the
                  Declaration of Rights of Man and Citizen: “Law is the
                  expression of the general will. Every citizen has a right to
                  participate personally, or through his representative, in its
                  foundation. It must be the same for all, whether it protects
                  or punishes.” For that period in time, those were radical
                  ideas, that the laws come from citizens, not from kings or
                  gods, and that those laws should apply to everyone equally.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So one might conclude that even though, the short-term
                  achievements of the revolution are not that impressive, the
                  long-term effect it had on the rest of world is truly
                  remarkable.
