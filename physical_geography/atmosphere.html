              <p>
                Atmosphere is the envelope of gases surrounding our planet, that
                is held in place by earth's gravitational force. Like a Cell
                Membrane, that regulates or filters what goes in and out of the
                cell, Our atmosphere acts as “the world’s biggest membrane” for
                the Earth.

              <p>
                Air is a mixture of gases that are odorless, tasteless,
                colorless, formless, and blend together so well they tend to act
                like a single gas. It can be felt only when it blows as wind.
              </p>
              <p>
                The recipe close to the Earth's surface is 99% nitrogen and
                oxygen, slightly less than 1% argon, and a tiny percent of
                volume comes from minor gases, like carbon dioxide. But this
                mostly consistent mixture starts to deviate as we get towards
                the outer edge of the atmosphere.

                dioxide and water vapour are found only up to 90 km from the
                surface of the earth.
              </p>
              <p>
                Carbon dioxide is meteorologically a very important gas as it is
                transparent to the incoming solar radiation but opaque to the
                outgoing terrestrial radiation. It absorbs a part of terrestrial
                (coming from earth) radiation and reflects back some part of it
                towards the earth’s surface. It is largely responsible for the
                green house effect. The volume of other gases is constant but
                the volume of carbon dioxide has been rising in the past few
                decades mainly because of the burning of fossil fuels. This has
                also increased the temperature of the air.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ozone is another important component of the atmosphere found
                between 10 and 50 km above the earth’s surface and acts as a
                filter and absorbs the ultra-violet rays radiating from the sun
                and prevents them from reaching the surface of the earth.
              </p>
              <h3>Water Vapour</h3>
              <p>
                Water vapour is also a variable gas in the atmosphere, which
                decreases with altitude. In the warm and wet tropics, it may
                account for 4% of the air by volume, while in the dry and cold
                areas of desert and polar regions, it may be less than 1% of the
                air.
              </p>
              <p>
                Water vapour also decreases from the equator towards the poles.
                It also absorbs parts of the insolation from the sun and
                preserves the earth’s radiated heat. It thus, acts like a
                blanket allowing the earth neither to become too cold nor too
                hot.
              </p>
              <h3>Dust Particles</h3>
              <p>
                Atmosphere has a sufficient capacity to keep small solid
                particles, which may originate from different sources and
                include sea salts, fine soil, smoke-soot, ash, pollen, dust and
                disintegrated particles of meteors.
              </p>
              <p>
                Dust particles are generally concentrated in the lower layers of
                the atmosphere; yet, convectional air currents may transport
                them to great heights. The higher concentration of dust
                particles is found in subtropical and temperate regions due to
                dry winds in comparison to equatorial and polar regions. Dust
                and salt particles act as <b>hygroscopic nuclei</b> around which
                water vapour condenses to produce clouds.
              </p>
              <h2>Structure</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                The atmosphere consists of different layers with varying
                density, air pressure and temperature.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Density and Pressure is highest near the surface of the earth
                  and decreases with increasing altitude.
                </li>
                <li>
                  However, the temperature has a more complicated profile with
                  altitude, and may remain relatively constant or even increase
                  with altitude in some regions. This temperature behavior
                  provides a useful metric to distinguish atmospheric layers.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The column of atmosphere is divided into five main layers
                depending upon the temperature condition. They are: troposphere,
                stratosphere, mesosphere, thermosphere and exosphere.
              </p>
              <div class="img mobile bigimg">
                <img

                />
              </div>

              <h3>Troposphere</h3>
              <p>
                The troposphere is the lowest layer of Earth's atmosphere. It
                contains 80% of the atmosphere's mass and 99% of the total mass
                of water vapour or moisture, so it is the
                <b
                  >layer where majority of Earth's weather phenomenon takes
                  place</b
                >.
              </p>
              <p>
                It extends from Earth's surface to an average height of about 13
                km, although this altitude varies from about 8 km at the poles
                to 18 km at the Equator. This difference is because, when the
                air molecules are cold, they huddle together, making the air
                denser and more compact. So in winter or near the poles, the
                troposphere is thinnest. And it’s thickest where the air
                molecules spread out, like in warm places at the equator.
              </p>
              <p>
                The temperature decrease in this layer averages about 1° C for
                every 165m of height or 6.5°C per 1,000 m. This is referred to
                as normal lapse rate of temperature.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b> Tropopause </b>
              </p>
              <p>
                The boundary region between the troposphere and the stratosphere
                is the tropopause. This region is marked by a
                <b>temperature inversion</b> i.e., starting from this region,
                the air ceases to cool with height. More formally, the
                tropopause is the region of the atmosphere where the
                environmental lapse rate changes from positive (as in the
                troposphere) to negative (as in the Stratosphere).
              </p>
              <h3>Stratosphere</h3>
              <p>
                The stratosphere is the second-lowest layer of Earth's
                atmosphere. It lies above the troposphere and is separated from
                it by the tropopause. This layer extends from roughly 13km up to
                an altitude of about 50km.
              </p>
              <p>
                One important feature of the stratosphere is that it contains
                the <b>ozone layer</b>. This layer absorbs ultra-violet
                radiation and shields life on the earth from intense, harmful
                form of energy.
              </p>
              <p>
                In stratosphere, temperatures rise with increasing altitude
                because of absorption of ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the Sun
                by the ozone layer.
              </p>
              <p>
                The stratospheric temperature provides very stable atmospheric
                conditions, so the stratosphere lacks the weather-producing air
                turbulence that is so prevalent in the troposphere.
                Consequently, the stratosphere is almost completely free of
                clouds and other forms of weather. The stratosphere is the
                highest layer that can be accessed by jet-powered aircraft.
              </p>
              <h3>Mesosphere</h3>
              <p>
                The mesosphere is the third highest layer of Earth's atmosphere,
                occupying the region above the stratosphere and below the
                thermosphere. It extends from the stratopause at an altitude of
                about 50 km to the mesopause at 80-85 km.
              </p>
              <p>
                In this layer, temperatures drop with increasing altitude. It is
                the coldest place on Earth and has an average temperature around
                −85 °C and coldest being -100 °C.
              </p>
              <p>
                The mesosphere is also the layer where most
                <b>meteors burn up</b> upon atmospheric entrance. The mesosphere
                is mainly accessed by rocket-powered aircraft.
              </p>

              <h3>Thermosphere</h3>
              <p>
                The thermosphere is the second-highest layer of Earth's
                atmosphere. It extends from the mesopause at an altitude of
                about 80 km up to the thermopause at an altitude range of
                500–700 km. The height of the thermopause varies considerably
                due to changes in solar activity.
              </p>
              <p>
                The lower part of the thermosphere, from 80 to 550 kilometres
                above Earth's surface, contains the
                <b>ionosphere</b>. This layer is ionized with electrically
                charged ions because of solar radiation. This layer plays a
                significant role in radio communication as it reflects the radio
                waves back to the Earth.
              </p>
              <p>
                The temperature of the thermosphere gradually increases with
                height and can reach as high as 1500 °C due to absorption of
                highly energetic solar radiation. Despite the high temperature,
                an observer or object will experience cold temperatures in the
                thermosphere, because the extremely low density of the gas
                (practically a hard vacuum) is insufficient for the molecules to
                conduct heat.
              </p>
              <p>
                Phenomena such as the <b>aurora borealis</b> (Northern Lights)
                and <b>aurora australis</b> (southern Lights) are occasionally
                seen in the thermosphere because of disturbances in the earth's
                magnetosphere caused by solar wind. The International Space
                Station and many of the satellites orbitting the earth are
                present in this layer.
              </p>

              <div class="note">
                <p>
                  <b> Karman line </b>
                  is an attempt to define a boundary between Earth's atmosphere
                  and outer space.
                </p>
              </div>
              <h3>Exosphere</h3>
              <p>
                The exosphere is the outermost layer of Earth's atmosphere (i.e.
                the upper limit of the atmosphere). It extends from the exobase,
                which is located at the top of the thermosphere at an altitude
                of about 700 km above sea level, to about 10,000 km where it
                merges into the solar wind.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Earth's exosphere is mostly hydrogen and helium, with some
                heavier atoms and molecules near the base. The atoms and
                molecules are so far apart that they can travel hundreds of
                kilometers without colliding with one another. Thus, the
                exosphere no longer behaves like a gas, and the particles
                constantly migrate in and out of the Earth's magnetosphere and
                the solar wind.
              </p>
              <p>
                The auroras sometimes occur in the lower part of the exosphere,
                where they overlap into the thermosphere. The exosphere also
                contains many of the satellites orbiting Earth.
