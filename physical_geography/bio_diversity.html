              <h1 class="title">Biodiversity and Conservation</h1>
              <p>
                Biodiversity itself is a combination of two words, Bio (life)
                and diversity (variety). In simple terms, biodiversity is the
                number and variety of organisms (plants, animals and
                micro-organisms) found within a specified geographic region.
                Biodiversity is our living wealth. It is a result of hundreds of
                millions of years of evolutionary history.
              </p>
              <h2>Levels of Biodiversity</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                Biodiversity can be discussed at three levels : (i) Genetic
                diversity; (ii) Species diversity; (iii) Ecosystem diversity.
              </p>
              <h3>Genetic Diversity</h3>
              <p>
                Genes are the basic building blocks of various life forms.
                Genetic biodiversity refers to the variation of genes within
                species. Groups of individual organisms having certain
                similarities in their physical characteristics are called
                species. Human beings genetically belong to the homo sapiens
                group and also differ in their characteristics such as height,
                colour, physical appearance, etc., considerably. This is due to
                genetic diversity.
              </p>
              <p>
                This genetic diversity is essential for a healthy breeding of
                population of species. Variation in a particular species
                population's gene pool allows natural selection to act upon
                traits that allow the population to adapt to changing
                environments.
              </p>
              <h3>Species Diversity</h3>
              <p>
                This refers to the variety of species. It relates to the number
                of species in a defined area. The diversity of species can be
                measured through its richness, abundance and types. Some areas
                are more rich in species than others. Areas rich in species
                diversity are called <b>hotspots</b> of diversity.
              </p>
              <h3>Ecosystem Diversity</h3>
              <p>
                Broad differences between ecosystem types and the diversity of
                habitats and ecological processes occurring within each
                ecosystem type constitute the ecosystem diversity. The
                ‘boundaries’ of communities (associations of species) and
                ecosystems are not very rigidly defined. Thus, the demarcation
                of ecosystem boundaries is difficult and complex.
              </p>
              <h2>Importance of Biodiversity</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                Biodiversity has contributed in many ways to the development of
                human culture and, in turn, human communities have played a
                major role in shaping the diversity of nature at the genetic,
                species and ecological levels. Biodiversity plays the following
                roles: ecological, economic and scientific.
              </p>
              <h3>Ecological Role of Biodiversity</h3>
              <p>
                Species of many kinds perform some function or the other in an
                ecosystem. Nothing in an ecosystem evolves and sustains without
                any reason. That means, every organism, besides extracting its
                needs, also contributes something of useful to other organisms.
              </p>
              <p>
                Species capture and store energy, produce and decompose organic
                materials, help to cycle water and nutrients throughout the
                ecosystem, fix atmospheric gases and help regulate the climate.
                These functions are important for ecosystem function and human
                survival.
              </p>
              <p>
                The more diverse an ecosystem, better are the chances for the
                species to survive through adversities and attacks, and
                consequently, is more productive. Hence, the loss of species
                would decrease the ability of the system to maintain itself.
                Just like a species with a high genetic diversity, an ecosystem
                with high biodiversity may have a greater chance of adapting to
                environmental change. In other words, the more the variety of
                species in an ecosystem, the more stable the ecosystem is likely
                to be.
              </p>
              <h3>Economic Role of Biodiversity</h3>
              <p>
                For all humans, biodiversity is an important resource in their
                day-to-day life. One important part of biodiversity is ‘crop
                diversity’, which is also called <b>agro-biodiversity</b>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Biodiversity is seen as a reservoir of resources to be drawn
                upon for the manufacture of food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic
                products. This concept of biological resources is responsible
                for the deterioration of biodiversity. At the same time, it is
                also the origin of new conflicts dealing with rules of division
                and appropriation of natural resources. Some of the important
                economic commodities that biodiversity supplies to humankind
                are: food crops, livestock, forests, fish, medicinal resources,
                etc.
              </p>
              <h3>Scientific Role of Biodiversity</h3>
              <p>
                Biodiversity is important because each species can give us some
                clue as to how life evolved and will continue to evolve.
                Biodiversity also helps in understanding how life functions and
                the role of each species in sustaining ecosystems of which we
                are also a species. This fact must be drawn upon every one of us
                so that we live and let other species also live their lives.

              <h2>Loss of Biodiversity</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                Since the last few decades, growth in human population has
                increased the rate of consumption of natural resources. It has
                accelerated the loss of species and habitation in different
                parts of the world.
              </p>
              <p>
                Tropical regions which occupy only about one-fourth of the total
                area of the world, contain about three-fourth of the world human
                population. Over-exploitation of resources and deforestation
                have become rampant to fulfil the needs of large population. As
                these tropical rain forests contain 50 per cent of the species
                on the earth, destruction of natural habitats have proved
                disastrous for the entire biosphere.
              </p>
              <p>
                Natural calamities such as earthquakes, floods, volcanic
                eruptions, forest fires, droughts, etc. cause damage to the
                flora and fauna of the earth, bringing change the biodiversity
                of respective affected regions. Pesticides and other pollutants
                such as hydrocarbons and toxic heavy metals destroy the weak and
                sensitive species.
              </p>
              <p>
                Species which are not the natural inhabitants of the local
                habitat but are introduced into the system, are called
                <b>exotic or alien species</b>. There are many examples when a
                natural biotic community of the ecosystem suffered extensive
                damage because of the introduction of exotic species.
              </p>
              <p>
                During the last few decades, some animals like tigers,
                elephants, rhinoceros, crocodiles, minks and birds were hunted
                mercilessly by poachers for their horn, tusks, hides, etc. It
                has resulted in the rendering of certain types of organisms as
                endangered category.
              </p>
              <h3>IUCN Classification</h3>
              <p>
                The International Union of Conservation of Nature and Natural
                Resources (IUCN) has classified the threatened species of plants
                and animals into three categories for the purpose of their
                conservation.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b> Endangered Species </b>
              </p>
              <p>
                It includes those species which are in danger of extinction. The
                IUCN publishes information about endangered species world-wide
                as the <b>Red List</b> of threatened species. Ex: Red Panda is
                an endangered species.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b> Vulnerable Species </b>
              </p>
              <p>
                This includes the species which are likely to be in danger of
                extinction in near future if the factors threatening to their
                extinction continue. Survival of these species is not assured as
                their population has reduced greatly
              </p>
              <p>
                <b> Rare Species </b>
              </p>
              <p>
                Population of these species is very small in the world; they are
                confined to limited areas or thinly scattered over a wider area.
              </p>
              <h2>Conservation of Biodiversity</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                Biodiversity is important for human existence. All forms of life
                are so closely interlinked that disturbance in one gives rise to
                imbalance in the others. If species of plants and animals become
                endangered, they cause degradation in the environment, which may
                threaten human being’s own existence.
              </p>
              <p>
                There is an urgent need to educate people to adopt
                environment-friendly practices and reorient their activities in
                such a way that our development is harmonious with other life
                forms and is sustainable. There is an increasing consciousness
                of the fact that such conservation with sustainable use is
                possible only with the involvement and cooperation of local
                communities and individuals. For this, the development of
                institutional structures at local levels is necessary. The
                critical problem is not merely the conservation of species nor
                the habitat but the continuation of process of conservation.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Government of India along with 155 other nations have signed
                the
                <b
                  >Convention of Biodiversity at the Earth Summit held at Rio de
                  Janeiro, Brazil in June 1992</b
                >. The world conservation strategy has suggested the following
                steps for biodiversity conservation:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Efforts should be made to preserve the species that are
                  endangered.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Prevention of extinction requires proper planning and
                  management.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Varieties of food crops, forage plants, timber trees,
                  livestock, animals and their wild relatives should be
                  preserved;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Each country should identify habitats of wild relatives and
                  ensure their protection.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Habitats where species feed, breed, rest and nurse their young
                  should be safeguarded and protected.
                </li>
                <li>
                  International trade in wild plants and animals be regulated.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                To protect, preserve and propagate the variety of species within
                natural boundaries, the Government of India passed the
                <b>Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972</b>, under which national
                parks and sanctuaries were established and biosphere reserves
                declared.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are some countries which are situated in the tropical
                region; they possess a large number of the world’s species
                diversity. They are called <b>mega diversity centres</b>. There
                are 17 such countries, namely Australia, Brazil, China,
                Colombia, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ecuador, India,
                Indonesia, Madagascar, Malaysia, Mexico, Papua New Guinea, Peru,
                Philippines, South Africa, United States and Venezuela.
              </p>
              <p>
                In order to concentrate resources on those areas that are most
                vulnerable, the International Union for the Conservation of
                Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) has identified certain areas
                as <b>biodiversity hotspots</b>. Around the world, 36 areas
                qualify under this designation. India contains three
                biodiversity hotspots - the Western Ghats, the Eastern
                Himalayas, and the Indo-Burma hotspot.

              </div>
              <p>
                Hotspots are defined according to their vegetation. Plants are
                important because these determine the primary productivity of an
                ecosystem. Most, but not all, of the hotspots rely on
                species-rich ecosystems for food, firewood, cropland, and income
                from timber. In Madagascar, for example, about 85 per cent of
                the plants and animals are found nowhere else in the world,
                Other hotspots in wealthy countries are facing different types
                of pressures. The islands of Hawaii have many unique plants and
                animals that are threatened by introduced species and land
                development.

                To protect and improve the natural environment including
                forests, lakes, rivers and wildlife and to have compassion for
                living creatures isn't just our fundamental duty. It is our
                ethical responsibility as well, to consider that each and every
                species along with us have an intrinsic right to exist. Hence,
                it is morally wrong to voluntarily cause the extinction of any
                species. The level of biodiversity is a good indicator of the
                state of our relationships with other living species. In fact,
                the concept of biodiversity is an integral part of many human
                cultures.
