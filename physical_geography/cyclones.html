              <h2>Cyclones</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                A cyclone is a large scale air mass that rotates around a strong
                center of low atmospheric pressure, counterclockwise in the
                Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere as
                viewed from above (opposite to an anticyclone). Cyclones are of
                two types:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Extratropical cyclones</li>
                <li>Tropical cyclones</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Extratropical cyclones</h3>
              <p>
                *To understand Extratropical cyclone, you need to know about
                fronts. You can read about them
                <a href='/physical_geography/atmospheric_circulation_weather_systems.html#fronts'>Here</a
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                The systems developing in the mid and high latitude, beyond the
                tropics are called the
                <b> mid-latitude or extra tropical cyclones</b>. The passage of
                front causes abrupt changes in the weather conditions over the
                area in the middle and high latitudes.
              </p>
              <p>
                Extra tropical cyclones form along the <b>polar front</b>.
                Initially, the front is stationary. In the northern hemisphere,
                warm air blows from the south and cold air from the north of the
                front. When the pressure drops along the front, the warm air
                moves northwards and the cold air move towards south, setting in
                motion an <b>anticlockwise cyclonic circulation</b>.
              </p>
              <div class="img bigimg">
                <img
                  src="../images/geography/polar_front.png"
                  alt="Polar Front"
                  style="width: 100%"
                />
              </div>
              <p>
                The cyclonic circulation leads to a well developed extra
                tropical cyclone, with a warm front and a cold front. The warm
                air glides over the cold air and a sequence of clouds appear
                over the sky ahead of the warm front and cause precipitation.
                The cold front approaches the warm air from behind and pushes
                the warm air up. As a result, cumulus clouds develop along the
                cold front. The cold front moves faster than the warm front
                ultimately overtaking the warm front. The warm air is completely
                lifted up and the front is occluded and the cyclone dissipates.
              </p>
              <div class="note">
                <p>
                  The extra-topical cyclones are intensified because of the
                  presence of <b>polar front jet stream</b> around the 60°
                  latitude which travels up to 450 kilometers per hour, wrapping
                  all around the planet.
                </p>
              </div>
              <h3>Tropical Cyclones</h3>
              <p>
                Tropical cyclones are violent storms that originate over
                <b>warm tropical oceans</b> and move over to the coastal areas
                bringing about large scale destruction caused by violent winds,
                very heavy rainfall and storm surges. This is one of the most
                devastating natural calamities.
              </p>
              <p>
                They are known as Cyclones in the Indian Ocean, Hurricanes in
                the Atlantic, Typhoons in the Western Pacific and South China
                Sea, and Willy-willies in the Western Australia. Tropical
                cyclones are typically between 100 and 2,000 km in diameter.
                They move slowly at a speed of about 300 to 500 kilometers per
                day.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Formation</b>
              </p>
              <p>
                Since the tropical regions recieve maximum insolation, the air
                there heats up and rises which forms a low pressure region. The
                air from surrounding high-pressure region quickly move towards
                this low pressure region. It too gets heated up, rises upto
                troposphere, condense and form cumulonimbus clouds.
              </p>
              <p>
                While this process goes on, another important phenomena comes
                into picture called <b>Coriolis force</b>. It is the force
                generated due to variations in rotational speeds of earth at
                equator and poles. It acts as a deflective force to the wind
                direction. Because of the Coriolis force, all winds are
                deflected to the right in the Northern Hemisphere while they are
                deflected to the left in the southern Hemisphere with respect to
                the rotating earth while moving from high pressure to low
                pressure area.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the center of every cyclone or hurricane lies an area of low
                pressure (with <b>temperature higher than 27° C</b>) which
                attracts the cool air from surrounding high pressure area. This
                central low-pressure region is called the
                <b>eye of the storm</b>. Around the eye is the <b>eye wall</b>,
                where there is a strong spiralling ascent of air to greater
                height reaching the tropopause. The wind reaches maximum
                velocity in this region, reaching as high as 250 km per hour.
                Torrential rain occurs here. From the eye wall
                <b>rain bands</b> may radiate and trains of cumulus and
                cumulonimbus clouds may drift into the outer region.

                Due to Coriolis Effect, in the northern hemisphere the cool air
                rushing towards the center of the storm is deflected slightly to
                the right. But this cool air keeps getting attracted towards the
                center because that's where the warm low-pressure zone is. This
                creates a spin in a counter-clockwise direction. Just the
                opposite happens in the southern hemisphere, due to the Coriolis
                effect, cool air gets deflected to the left and as a result the
                spinning of this cyclone is in a clockwise direction.

                Cyclone occurs over the ocean surface and coastal region because
                there is a continuous supply of moisture from the ocean or sea.
                When it reaches the land, the moisture supply is cut off and the
                storm dissipates. The place where tropical cyclone crosses the
                coast is called the <b>landfall of the cyclone</b>.

                <h3 style="text-align: center">Thunderstorms and Tornadoes</h3>
                <p>
                  They are of short duration, occurring over a small area but
                  are violent. Thunderstorms are caused by intense convection on
                  moist hot days. A thunderstorm is a
                  <b
                    >well-grown cumulonimbus cloud producing thunder and
                    lightening</b
                  >. Sometime they populate the rainbands of tropical cyclones.
                  When the clouds extend to heights where sub-zero temperature
                  prevails, hails are formed and they come down as hailstorm. If
                  there is insufficient moisture, a thunderstorm can generate
                  dust-storms. A thunderstorm is characterised by intense
                  updraft of rising warm air, which causes the clouds to grow
                  bigger and rise to greater height. This causes precipitation.
                  Later, downdraft brings down to earth the cool air and the
                  rain.
                </p>
                <p>
                  From severe thunderstorms sometimes spiralling wind descends
                  with great force, with very low pressure at the centre,
                  causing massive destruction on its way. Such a phenomenon is
                  called a <b>tornado</b> (or twisters). Tornadoes generally
                  occur in middle latitudes. The tornado over the sea is called
                  water spouts.

                <h3 style="text-align: center">Anti-Cyclone</h3>
                <p>
                  As the name suggest, Anti-Cyclones are exactly opposite to the
                  Cyclones. In an anti-cyclone, a large-scale circulation of
                  winds around a central region of <b>high pressure</b>,
                  clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and counterclockwise in
                  the Southern Hemisphere as viewed from above, occurs.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Effects of surface-based anticyclones include clearing skies
                  as well as cooler, drier air. Fog can also form overnight
                  within a region of higher pressure.
