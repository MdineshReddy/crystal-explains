              <p>
                The earth receives almost all of its energy from the sun. The
                energy received by the earth is known as incoming solar
                radiation or in short '<b>insolation</b>'.
              </p>

              <h3>Variability of Insolation at the Surface of the Earth</h3>
              <p>
                The amount and the intensity of insolation vary during a day, in
                a season and in a year. The factors that cause these variations
                in insolation are :
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>The rotation of earth on its axis</b>: The fact that the
                  earth’s axis makes an angle of 66½ with the plane of its orbit
                  (Ecliptic Plane) round the sun has a greater influence on the
                  amount of insolation received at different latitudes.
                </li>
                <li><b>The length of the day</b>.</li>

                  from tropics to poles, the angle of sunrays goes on slanting,
                  the energy gets distributed and the net energy received per

                  <b>The Passage of Solar Radiation through the Atmosphere</b>:
                  The incoming solar radiation passes through the atmosphere
                  before striking the earth’s surface. Within the troposphere
                  water vapour, ozone and other gases absorb much of the near
                  infrared radiation. Very small-suspended particles in the
                  troposphere scatter visible spectrum both to the space and
                  towards the earth surface. This process adds colour to the
                  sky. The red colour of the rising and the setting sun and the
                  blue colour of the sky are the result of scattering of light
                  within the atmosphere.

                All objects -- the Sun, the Earth, even our body -- are
                constantly emitting waves of electromagnetic radiation. Very hot
                and high energy objects, like the Sun, emit vast amounts of
                energy as
                <b>short wavelengths</b>, or <b>solar radiation</b>, in the form
                of light. Cooler objects, like the Earth, emit much
                <b>longer heat waves</b>, or <b>terrestrial radiation</b>.
              </p>
              <div class="note">
                Plank’s law states that hotter a body, the more energy it will
                radiate and shorter the wavelength of that radiation.

              <p>
                Since there's constant sunlight passing through the atmosphere,
                we might expect temperatures to keep increasing, like when
                you're sitting under a blanket and get so hot that you want to
                throw it off.
              </p>
              <p>
                Fortunately, the Earth doesn't get swelteringly hot because the
                Earth and the atmosphere naturally balance the shortwave solar
                energy that arrives with the longwave energy sent back to space.
                This is the <b>atmospheric energy budget</b>, or simply
                <b>Heat Budget</b>.

              <h3>Short Wave Solar Radiation</h3>
              <p>
                Assume that our sunbeam has 100 units of radiant energy. Called
                the <b>Albedo</b>, roughly 35 units are reflected back to space
                even before reaching the earth’s surface. Of these, 27 units are
                reflected back from the top of the clouds, 2 units from the snow
                and ice-covered areas of the earth and 6 units is scattered by
                Dust, smoke, and volcanic emissions etc int the atmosphere.
              </p>
              <p>
                The remaining 65 units are absorbed, 14 units within the
                atmosphere and 51 units by the earth’s surface.
              </p>
              <h3>Long Wave Solar Radiation</h3>
              <p>
                The earth radiates back 51 units in the form of terrestrial
                radiation. Of these,
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>17 units are radiated to space directly and</li>
                <li>
                  34 units are absorbed by the atmosphere (6 units absorbed
                  directly by the atmosphere, 9 units through convection and
                  turbulence and 19 units through latent heat of condensation).
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                48 units absorbed by the atmosphere (14 units from insolation
                +34 units from terrestrial radiation) are also radiated back
                into space. Thus, the total radiation returning from the earth
                and the atmosphere respectively is 17+48=65 units which balance
                the total of 65 units received from the sun. This is termed the
                heat budget or heat balance of the earth.

                <b>Variation in the Net Heat Budget at the Earth’s Surface:</b>
                <p>
                  As we have seen, there are variations in insolation received
                  at different latitudes on earth’s surface. As a result, there
                  is a surplus of net radiation near the tropics and the regions
                  near the poles have a deficit.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The surplus heat energy from the tropics is redistributed pole
                  wards and as a result the tropics do not get progressively
                  heated up due to the accumulation of excess heat or the high
                  latitudes get permanently frozen due to excess deficit.

                The interaction of insolation with the atmosphere and the

                temperature.

              <h3>Factors Controlling Temperature Distribution</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>The latitude of the Place:</b> The temperature of a place
                  depends on the insolation received. We have already seen that
                  places near the equator and the tropics receive higher
                  insolation than those near the poles. Hence the temperature
                  also varies accordingly.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>The altitude:</b> The atmosphere is indirectly heated by
                  terrestrial radiation from below. Therefore, the places near
                  the sea-level record higher temperature than the places
                  situated at higher elevations. In other words, the temperature
                  generally decreases with increasing height. The rate of
                  decrease of temperature with height is termed as the
                  <b>normal lapse rate</b>. It is 6.5°C per 1,000 m.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Distance from the sea:</b> Compared to land, the sea gets
                  heated slowly and loses heat slowly. Land heats up and cools
                  down quickly. Therefore, the variation in temperature over the
                  sea is less compared to land. The places situated near the sea
                  come under the moderating influence of the sea and land
                  breezes which moderate the temperature.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Air-mass and Ocean currents:</b> The places, which come
                  under the influence of warm air-masses experience higher
                  temperature and the places that come under the influence of
                  cold air-masses experience low temperature. Similarly, the
                  places located on the coast where the warm ocean currents flow
                  record higher temperature than the places located on the coast
                  where the cold currents flow.

                <p>
                  The distribution of temperature is studied with the help of
                  isotherms. The Isotherms are lines on the maps joining places
                  having equal temperature.

              <h3>Distribution of Temperature</h3>
              <p>
                Two months in particular are important that we need to
                specifically look at: January and July.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  During the month of January, the northern hemisphere has an
                  ongoing winter season. It means northern hemisphere of Earth
                  is tilted away from the Sun and that southern hemisphere
                  exposed more towards the sunrays.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Likewise, in the month of July the northern hemisphere
                  witnesses summer season. This time the southern hemisphere of
                  the earth is tilted away from the Sun and that makes the
                  northern hemisphere more exposed towards the sunrays.

              </div>
              <p>
                As you can notice, the effect of the latitude on temperature is
                well pronounced on the map, as the isotherms are generally
                parallel to the latitude.
              </p>
              <p>
                The deviation from this general trend is more pronounced in
                January than in July, especially in the northern hemisphere.
                This is because, in northern hemisphere the land surface area is
                much larger than in the southern hemisphere. Hence, the effects
                of land mass and the ocean currents are well pronounced.
              </p>
              <p>
                In January the isotherms deviate to the north over the ocean and
                to the south over the continent. This can be seen on the North
                Atlantic Ocean. The presence of warm ocean currents, Gulf Stream
                and North Atlantic drift, make the Northern Atlantic Ocean
                warmer and the isotherms bend towards the north. Over the land
                the temperature decreases sharply and the isotherms bend towards
                south in Europe. It is much pronounced in the Siberian plain.

                In July the isotherms generally run parallel to the latitude.
              </p>
              <h3>Temperature Inversion</h3>
              <p>
                Normally, temperature decreases with increase in elevation in
                Troposphere. It is called normal lapse rate. At times, the
                situations is reversed and the normal lapse rate is inverted. It
                is called Inversion of temperature.
              </p>

              <p>
                A long winter night with clear skies and still air is ideal
                situation for inversion. The heat of the day is radiated off
                during the night, and by early morning hours, the earth is
                cooler than the air above. This inversion commonly lasts for few
                hours until the sun comes up and begins to warm the earth. Over
                polar areas, temperature inversion is normal throughout the
                year.
              </p>
              <p>
                Surface inversion promotes stability in the lower layers of the
                atmosphere. Smoke and dust particles get collected beneath the
                inversion layer and spread horizontally to fill the lower strata
                of the atmosphere. Dense fogs in mornings are common occurrences
                especially during winter season.
              </p>
              <p>
                The inversion also takes place in hills and mountains due to air
                drainage. Cold air at the hills and mountains, produced during
                night, flows under the influence of gravity. Being heavy and
                dense, the cold air acts almost like water and moves down the
                slope to pile up deeply in pockets and valley bottoms with warm
                air above. This is called air drainage. It protects plants from
                frost damages.
