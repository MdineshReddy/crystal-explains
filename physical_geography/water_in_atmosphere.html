              <h2>Humidity</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                You know that the air contains water vapour.
                <b>Humidity</b> describes how much water vapor is in the air. In
                general, the air at high latitudes like in the Arctic and the
                Antarctic is naturally colder because of less sunlight, so it
                has much less water vapor and is less humid. Places like the
                Caribbean or other tropical and equatorial regions of Earth have
                hotter air with more water vapor and more humidity.
              </p>
              <p>
                The percentage of moisture present in the atmosphere as compared
                to its full capacity at a given temperature is known as the
                <b>relative humidity</b>. The actual amount of the water vapour
                present in the atmosphere is known as the
                <b>absolute humidity</b>. With the change of air temperature,
                the capacity to retain moisture increases or decreases and the
                relative humidity is also affected.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  At higher temperatures, it’s more likely that more liquid
                  water molecules will have the energy to evaporate into water
                  vapor and float around in the atmosphere. So in hotter areas,
                  the air can “hold” more water. Of course, just because warm
                  air can hold more water doesn't mean that there's always water
                  vapor around. Inland regions, like the central Sahara desert,
                  are very dry because they’re far from the oceans and there’s
                  not a lot of liquid water available to be evaporated.
                </li>
                <li>
                  But let's say we're staying in a cabin by a lake -- so there's
                  plenty of liquid water around. The same relative humidity can
                  feel very different depending on the air temperature.
                </li>
                <ul style="list-style-type: square">
                  <li>
                    On a hot day, 70% relative humidity can feel heavy, sticky,
                    and uncomfortable, almost like standing in a cloud. Because
                    the air can hold more total water, 70% of saturation is a
                    lot of vapor.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    On a cold day, 70% relative humidity is much more
                    comfortable because the colder air can hold less water, so
                    70% of saturation isn't as much water vapor.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </ul>
              <p>
                When air at a certain temperature is at 100% relative humidity,
                it contains the maximum amount of water vapor possible. So it’s
                saturated -- like a sponge full of water that can't soak up any
                more unless you squeeze it out. Except "squeezing water out" of
                the atmosphere is rain.
              </p>
              <div class="note">
                <p>
                  <b>Dew Point:</b> is the temperature at which air is saturated
                  with water vapor and condensation is imminent.

              </div>

              <h3>Evaporation and Condensation</h3>
              <p>
                The amount of water vapour in the atmosphere is added or
                withdrawn due to evaporation and condensation respectively.
                Evaporation is a process by which water is transformed from
                liquid to gaseous state. Heat is the main cause for evaporation.
                The temperature at which the water starts evaporating is
                referred to as the <b>latent heat of vapourisation.</b>
              </p>
              <p>
                The transformation of water vapour into water is called
                condensation. Condensation is caused by the loss of heat. When
                moist air is cooled, it may reach a level when its capacity to
                hold water vapour ceases. Then, the excess water vapour
                condenses into liquid form. If it directly condenses into solid
                form, it is known as <b>sublimation</b>. In free air,
                condensation results from cooling around very small particles of
                dust, smoke, volcanic ash and salt, which are termed as
                <b>hygroscopic condensation nuclei</b>.
              </p>
              <p>
                After condensation the water vapour or the moisture in the
                atmosphere takes one of the following forms — dew, frost, fog
                and clouds depending on whether the dew point is lower or higher
                than the freezing point.
              </p>

              <h2>Clouds</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                Cloud is a mass of minute water droplets or tiny crystals of ice
                formed by the condensation of the water vapour in free air at
                considerable elevations. Each cloud has its own anatomy, height,
                name, and reason for being. But the vast majority of clouds are
                classified into four types, based on the way they look.

                  clouds or “mare’s tails” are made up of ice crystals, and they
                  only exist way high up above 6000 meters. Cirrus clouds
                  reflect about 50% of insolation, or incoming solar radiation
                  that passes through them. But they’re even better at trapping
                  longwave radiation trying to move back out to space,
                  insulating and warming the Earth’s atmosphere as part of the
                  natural greenhouse effect.

                <li>
                  <b>Stratus clouds:</b> are dull, gray, flat, horizontal layers
                  of low-level clouds that appear below 2000 meters. Stratus
                  clouds reflect and scatter about 90% of insolation that passes
                  through them, which cools the Earth by keeping incoming energy
                  from reaching the ground. They are to blame for dreary
                  weather.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Cumulus Clouds:</b> look like cotton wool. Because they can
                  be so thick and reach so far up into the atmosphere, they
                  generally reflect as much energy away from the Earth as they
                  absorb to warm the Earth. So they’re basically neutral in
                  terms of warming the atmosphere.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Nimbus Clouds:</b> Nimbus clouds are black or dark gray.
                  They form at middle levels or very near to the surface of the
                  earth. These are extremely dense and opaque to the rays of the
                  sun. Sometimes, the clouds are so low that they seem to touch
                  the ground. <b>Cumulonimbus clouds</b> are towering rain
                  clouds which showcase a powerhouse of energy exploding as big
                  storms.

                While cirrus clouds only appear at high levels, stratus and
                cumulus clouds can appear at any level. And cloud names actually
                describe this. Cumulus clouds growing in the middle above 2000
                meters but below 6000 meters -- at the alto level are called
                altocumulus.
              </p>
              <p>
                We could also have horizontal stratus clouds way high above 6000
                meters, forming icy cirrostratus layers. Cirrus or the prefix
                cirro means high-level, alto refers to the mid-level, and
                low-level clouds are just plain stratus or cumulus.

              <h2>Precipitation</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                The process of continuous condensation in free air helps the
                condensed particles to grow in size. When the resistance of the
                air fails to hold them against the force of gravity, they fall
                on to the earth’s surface. So after the condensation of water
                vapour, the release of moisture is known as precipitation.
              </p>
              <h3>Types of precipitation:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The precipitation in the form of water is called
                  <b>rainfall</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When the temperature is lower than the 0 degree C,
                  precipitation takes place in the form of fine hexagonal
                  crystals/flakes of snow and is called <b>snowfall</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Sleet</b> is frozen raindrops and refrozen melted
                  snow-water. When a layer of air with the temperature above
                  freezing point overlies a subfreezing layer near the ground,
                  precipitation takes place in the form of sleet. Raindrops,
                  which leave the warmer air, encounter the colder air below. As
                  a result, they solidify and reach the ground as small pellets
                  of ice not bigger than the raindrops from which they are
                  formed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Sometimes, drops of rain after being released by the clouds
                  become solidified into small rounded solid pieces of ice and
                  which reach the surface of the earth are called
                  <b>hailstones</b>. These are formed by the rainwater passing
                  through the colder layers. Hailstones have several concentric
                  layers of ice one over the other.

              <h3>Types of Rainfall</h3>
              <p>
                On the basis of origin, rainfall may be classified into three
                main types – the convectional, orographic or relief and the
                cyclonic or frontal.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b> Convectional Rain </b>
              </p>
              <p>
                The, air on being heated, becomes light and rises up in
                convection currents. As it rises, it expands and loses heat and
                consequently, condensation takes place and cumulous clouds are
                formed. With thunder and lightening, heavy rainfall takes place
                but this does not last long. Such rain is common in the summer
                or in the hotter part of the day. It is very common in the
                equatorial regions and interior parts of the continents,
                particularly in the northern hemisphere.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Orographic Rain or Relief Rain</b>
              </p>
              <p>
                When the saturated air mass comes across a mountain, it is
                forced to ascend and as it rises, it expands; the temperature
                falls, and the moisture is condensed.
              </p>
              <p>
                The chief characteristic of this sort of rain is that the
                windward slopes receive greater rainfall. After giving rain on
                the windward side, when these winds reach the other slope, they
                descend, and their temperature rises. Then their capacity to
                take in moisture increases and hence, these leeward slopes
                remain rainless and dry. The area situated on the leeward side,
                which gets less rainfall is known as the
                <b>rain-shadow area</b>.
              </p>

                <b> Cyclonic Rain or Frontal Rainfall </b>
              </p>
              <p>
                Cyclonic rainfall (or) frontal rain, is caused when two air
                masses of different temperatures meet and the warm air rises
                over the heavier cool air, it cools and creates a front; clouds
                form and produce rain.
              </p>
              <h3>World Distribution of Rainfall</h3>
              <p>
                Different places on the earth’s surface receive different
                amounts of rainfall in a year and that too in different seasons.
                In general,
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  As we proceed from the equator towards the poles, rainfall
                  goes on decreasing steadily.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The coastal areas of the world receive greater amounts of
                  rainfall than the interior of the continents.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The rainfall is more over the oceans than on the landmasses of
                  the world because of being great sources of water.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Between the latitudes 35<sup>o</sup> and 40<sup>o</sup> N and
                  S of the equator, the rain is heavier on the eastern coasts
                  and goes on decreasing towards the west. But, between 45<sup
                    >o</sup
                  >
                  and 65<sup>o</sup> N and S of equator, due to the westerlies,
                  the rainfall is first received on the western margins of the
                  continents and it goes on decreasing towards the east.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Wherever mountains run parallel to the coast, the rain is
                  greater on the coastal plain, on the windward side and it
                  decreases towards the leeward side.
                </li>
