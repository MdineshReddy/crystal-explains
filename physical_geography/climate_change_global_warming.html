              <p>
                The terms “climate change” and “global warming” are often used
                interchangeably. But even though these phenomena are closely
                related, there is a difference between them.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Climate change</b> is the change in average weather
                  patterns in a region over a long period of time. These changes
                  can be natural or anthropogenic, meaning human induced.
                </li>
                <li>
                  On the other hand, <b>global warming</b> is the increase in
                  the average surface temperature of our planet.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Essentially, when the planet gets warmer, climates change. We
                know the Earth has had many different climates thanks to
                paleoclimatologists, who study past climates through proxy data,
                or data that provide clues about the climate of the past. The
                geomorphological features, especially in high altitudes and high
                latitudes, exhibit traces of advances and retreats of glaciers.
                The sediment deposits in glacial lakes also reveal the
                occurrence of warm and cold periods. The rings in the trees
                provide clues about wet and dry periods. Historical records
                describe the vagaries in climate. All these evidences indicate
                that change in climate is a natural and continuous process.
              </p>
              <p>
                The type of climate we experience now might be prevailing over
                the last 10,000 years with minor and occasionally wide
                fluctuations. The planet earth has witnessed many variations in
                climate since the beginning. Geological records show alteration
                of glacial and inter-glacial periods. We're in an interglacial
                period now, and glaciers are melting faster than ever before in
                the geologic record.
              </p>

              <h3>Climate in the Recent Past</h3>
              <p>
                In our current period of global warming, there’s been a
                well-documented rise of average temperatures around the globe
                since the Industrial Revolution in the 1700s-1800s.
              </p>
              <p>
                This climate change is anthropogenic meaning it is the result of
                human activities that increase greenhouse gases emissions, like
                carbon dioxide (CO2), Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), methane (CH4),
                ozone (O3 and nitrous oxide (N2O). They trap solar energy, so
                more heat is held in the atmosphere. That additional energy is
                changing not only the average temperature, but also climate
                processes within the atmosphere and oceans. These include more
                extreme storms, heat waves, droughts, changing regional
                temperature and precipitation patterns that cause vegetation
                zones to shift, and glaciers to melt -- which results in sea
                level rise and changing coastlines.
              </p>
              <p>
                Average annual global temperatures have risen between 0.3
                degrees C and 0.6 degrees C and sea level has risen between 10
                and 25 cm during the past 100 years. And in 2016, global
                atmospheric carbon dioxide levels passed the 400 parts per
                million mark, which is higher than at any time in the past
                million years.
              </p>
              <h3>Causes of Climate Change</h3>
              <p>
                Based on that proxy data, paleoclimatologists hypothesize that
                climates change because of any combination of several driving
                forces.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  First, past climates could’ve changed because of orbital
                  causes -- like changes in the shape of the Earth’s orbit, its
                  tilt on its axis, and the time of year when the Sun is closest
                  to the Earth. Like calculations by the mathematician Milutin
                  Milankovitch show that lots of glacial cycles occur every
                  million years.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Second, volcanic activity can release enormous amounts of
                  volcanic dust into the stratosphere. Strong winds spread that
                  dust around the world, darken the skies, and reduce the amount
                  of insolation that can reach the surface, which lowers
                  temperatures.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Another reason that climates change is when continents and
                  oceans get rearranged. Like when the Isthmus of Panama formed,
                  it broke the connection between the Atlantic and Pacific.
                  Oceans which re-directed ocean circulation and created the
                  Gulf Stream. This changed how moisture and ocean currents
                  moved around the globe, which as we know contributes to
                  climate patterns.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                The most important anthropogenic effect on the climate is the
                increasing trend in the concentration of greenhouse gases in the
                atmosphere which is likely to cause global warming. Human
                activities -- like burning fossil fuels, industrialization,
                modern agriculture, and deforestation -- have caused most of the
                Earth’s warming since the mid-20th century.

                We know rising temperatures are correlated with rising carbon
                dioxide in the atmosphere, and the amount of carbon dioxide
                generated by our day to day actions can have an effect on the
                other side of the world. But while individual actions matter,
                who is emitting carbon dioxide is highly unequal.

              <h3>Effects</h3>
              <p>
                Knowing who or what is emitting carbon dioxide is only part of
                understanding climate change. We also need to know whom those
                emissions affect and the geographical impacts of a warming
                planet.
              </p>

              <p>
                Not all areas will be affected equally by global warming and
                modern climate change. While materially rich countries are the
                main producers of greenhouse gas emissions, materially poorer
                countries will bear most of the impacts -- like becoming
                <b>climate refugees</b>, people being forced to flee their homes
                for safer places.

                Thousands of low-lying islands and coastal cities face a threat
                of rising sea levels by the end of the 21st century, when sea
                levels are predicted to have risen 26 to 77 centimeters. That’s
                pretty significant considering over half of the world’s people
                live within 100 kilometers of a coastline.

                  alt="Onotoa Atoll"

                  <h4>Onotoa Atoll, Kiribati</h4>

              </div>
              <p>
                For example, located halfway between Australia and Hawaii,
                Kiribati has 33 atolls that sit less than 2 meters above sea
                level, and average only a few hundred meters wide. The
                government of Kiribati is planning a 2-phase
                <b>“migration with dignity”</b> and has purchased several
                thousand acres of land in Fiji, as a potential resettlement
                location for its 102,000 residents.
              </p>
              <p>
                But "migration with dignity" isn't an option for all countries
                and communities. For some places, adaptation is the only option,
                like building sea walls or raising streets and homes. And for
                some that will mean moving to higher elevations after the
                flooding without government support for the process. Flooding
                from sea level rise is just one of many changes that we can
                anticipate.
              </p>
              <p>
                Other places, for example, will experience drier conditions with
                the potential for droughts, heat waves, and wildfires. The
                current ways the Earth's climate is changing because of global
                warming will affect all of us as individuals, so it's our
                collective responsibility to pay attention and take action.

              <h3>Conclusion</h3>
              <p>
                Looking after our planet and all its dynamic ecosystems and
                landscapes is everyone’s job. To do that, our individual choices
                can make a difference, but we also have to hold governments and
                corporations responsible for the policies and large-scale
                emissions that affect our atmosphere and climate. This will
                ensure safer, healthier, and more biodiverse futures for the
                next generations who inherit our planet.
