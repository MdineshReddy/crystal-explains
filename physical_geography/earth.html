              <h2 id="geological_history">Geological History of Earth</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>

              <p>
                Earth was formed about 4.6 billion years ago by accretion from
                the solar nebula, a disk-shaped mass of dust and gas left over
                from the formation of the Sun, which also created the rest of
                the Solar System.
              </p>
              <p>
                The geological history of Earth is studied from the fossils of
                animals found in planet's rock layers (stratigraphy). The
                Geologic Time Scale is divided into Eons > Eras > Periods >
                Epochs. For simplicity, we won't be discussing each period and
                epoch separately.
              </p>
              <p>
                The geological history is broadly divided into two periods: the
                Precambrian Super-Eon and the Phanerozoic Eon.
              </p>
              <h3>Precambrian Super-Eon</h3>
              <p>
                It includes approximately 90% of geologic time starting from 4.6
                billion years ago to the beginning of the Cambrian Period (about
                541 Ma). This Super-Eon includes three eons, the Hadean,
                Archean, and Proterozoic.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b> Hadean Eon (4.6 - 4 billion years ago) </b>
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  It begins with the very formation of the Earth itself, around
                  4.6 billion years ago and ends 4 billion years ago. Earth was
                  initially molten due to extreme volcanism and frequent
                  collisions with other bodies.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Named after the Greek underworld Hades, the Hadean lived up to
                  its name. The planet was wracked by volcanic activity, cosmic
                  bombardments, raging storms, and temperatures that were at
                  times hot enough to melt rock.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Moon formed soon afterwards, possibly as a result of the
                  impact of a large planetoid with the Earth.
                </li>

                <li>
                  This is the only Eon that doesn’t have fossils. Outgassing and
                  volcanic activity produced the primordial atmosphere.
                  Condensing water vapor, augmented by ice delivered from
                  comets, produced the oceans within 500 million years from the
                  formation of the earth.

                  Named after the Greek word for ‘origin’, the Archean was once
                  thought to be when the first signs of life appeared. But at
                  the very least, it’s fair to say it was the first time that
                  life flourished, forming mats of microbes in the primordial

                  This period starting with <b>Cambrian explosion</b>, was

                  Throughout the early Paleozoic, the Earth's landmass was
                  broken up into a substantial number of relatively small
                  continents. Toward the end of the era the continents gathered
                  together into a supercontinent called <b>Pangaea</b>, which
                  included most of the Earth's land area. It was surrounded by

                <li>
                  During this period, Pangaea gradually split into a northern

                <li>
                  This period was dominated by the reptiles. This is when they
                  took some of their most famous forms, including dinosaurs,
                  pterosaurs, and a variety of marine species. And many modern
                  groups of organisms also evolved like mammals frogs, bees, and
                  flowering plants.
                </li>
                <li>
                  But the Mesozoic Era came to an end 66 million years ago, with
                  yet another episode of devastation, known as the
                  Cretaceous-Paleogene, or K-Pg, Extinction Event. A gigantic
                  asteroid that struck the earth, sending out enormous amounts
                  of ash into the atmosphere, blocking out sunlight, and
                  creating a vicious cold snap across the planet.

                <li>
                  Without the sun’s energy, entire plant communities died, and
                  the animals that relied on those plants perished with them.
                  Evidence of this impact can be found in a layer of iridium, in
                  rocks dating to the end of the Mesozoic. Iridium is an element
                  that’s rare on Earth, but very common in asteroids and comets.

                  Near the end of Mesozoic, Pangaea completed its breakup into

                    >: The Earth entered a glacial period. This epoch is
                    famously referred to as <b>The Ice Age</b>. Many animals

                    of the worst droughts in Africa, and led to the expansion of
                    primitive humans. As the Pleistocene drew to a close, a
                    major extinction wiped out much of the world's megafauna,

              <h2>Movement of Earth</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>Earth has two kinds of motions: Rotation and Revolution.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Rotation is the movement of earth around its own axis from
                  West to East, once in every 24 hours. It causes day and
                  nights.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Revolution is the movement of earth around the Sun in an
                  elliptical orbit, once in every 365 1/4 days. It causes the
                  seasons and years.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Rotation of Earth</h3>
              <p>
                The Earth spins, or rotates, on an <b>imaginary axis</b> that
                runs from the North Pole through the center of the planet to the
                South Pole.
              </p>
              <p>
                It takes the Earth just under 24 hours (approximately), or one
                day, to spin once on its axis. At the equator, the Earth is
                actually spinning at about 1600 kilometers per hour. This
                rotational speed goes on decreasing from equator to poles where
                it becomes almost zero.
              </p>

              <p>Earth's rotation has the following implications:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Causation of Day and Night.</li>
                <li>Change in direction of winds and ocean currents.</li>
                <li>Rise and fall of tides every day.</li>
                <li>
                  A difference of time of one hour between the two meridians
                  which are 15<sup>o</sup> apart.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                At any given time, only one half of the earth faces the sun
                which experiences day, while the other half experiences night.
                The circle that divides these two halves is called the
                <b>Circle of Illumination.</b>

              <h3>Revolution of Earth</h3>
              <p>
                The Earth travels on a 940 million kilometer path around the
                Sun, called an orbit. One complete orbit is a revolution, which
                takes 365 and 6 hours. The surplus is added as an extra day
                (leap day) every 4 years.
              </p>
              <p>
                Earth’s orbit is actually elliptical, like a slightly
                stretched-out circle. This means that the distance between the
                Earth and Sun varies a bit throughout the year.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Specifically, the Earth is nearest the Sun (147 million), or
                  at perihelion, in January.

                  <li>
                    The Earth actually tilts 23.5 degrees away from a line
                    perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic ( the imaginary
                    plane that contains Earth’s orbit).

                represent the angular distance of any location from the center
                of the Earth. Both latitudes and longitudes are measured in

                  Often called parallels or circles of latitude, latitudes are
                  imaginary circles parallel to the Equator.

                  <b>The Equator</b> is an imaginary line perpendicular to
                  earth's axis. It is equidistant from the North and South
                  Poles, and divides the globe into the
                  <b>Northern Hemisphere</b> and the <b>Southern Hemisphere</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Latitudes specify the north-south position of a location from
                  the equator on the globe.

                  <li>
                    Locations in the Northern Hemisphere are identified by
                    northern latitudes and are assigned a suffix of N for north.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Southern Hemisphere locations, on the other hand, are on

                <li>
                  The equator is considered as Zero degrees latitude. Since the
                  distance from the equator to either of the poles is one-fourth
                  of a circle round the earth, it will measure ¼th of 360
                  degrees, i.e. 90°. Thus, 90° north latitude (N) marks the
                  North Pole and 90° south latitude (S) marks the South Pole.

                  overhead at least once a year on all latitudes in between the
                  Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn. It, therefore,
                  receives the maximum heat.

                  Observatory at Greenwich, England, is considered as the
                  reference point for longitudes. This line is also known as the

                </li>
                <li>
                  The meridian opposite the Prime Meridian (on the other side of
                  the Earth) is the 180° longitude and is known as the
                  <b>antimeridian</b> or the

                <li>
                  When the Prime Meridian of Greenwich has the sun at the
                  highest point in the sky, all the places along this meridian
                  will have mid-day or noon
                </li>
                <li>
                  Since the earth rotates from west to east, those places east
                  of Greenwich will be ahead of Greenwich time and those to the
                  west will be behind it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Time along a longitude is calculated this way - the earth
                  rotates 360° in about 24 hours, which means 15° an hour or 1°
                  in four minutes. Thus, when it is noon at Greenwich, the time
                  at 15° east of Greenwich will be 15 × 4 = 60 minutes or 1 hour
                  ahead of Greenwich time and at 15° west of Greenwich, the time
                  will be behind Greenwich time by one hour.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Since a country has many meridians passing through it, the
                  local time of places which are on different meridians is bound
                  to differ.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In India, for instance, there will be a difference of about 1
                  hour and 45 minutes in the local times of Dwarka in Gujarat
                  and Dibrugarh in Assam.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Therefore, in India, the longitude of
                  <b>82½° E (82° 30' E)</b> is treated as the standard meridian.
                  The local time at this meridian is taken as the standard time
                  for the whole country. It is known as the

                is tilted towards the Sun. Everything south of Antarctic Circle
                (66.5° S) receives 24 hours of daylight. And at noon, the Sun’s

              <p>
                But the tilt of the Earth means that on the December Solstice,

              <h2>Eclipses</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                An Eclipse Occurs when the Sun, the Moon and the Earth are in a
                Straight line. There are two types of eclipses:- Solar Eclipse
                and Lunar Eclipse.
              </p>
              <h3>Solar Eclipse</h3>
              <p>
                Solar Eclipse happens when a new moon moves between the Earth
                and the sun, blocking some or all of the sun's rays from
                reaching the Earth. By cosmic chance, even though the sun is 400
                times wider than the moon, it's also 400 times farther away.
                Therefore, the two objects appear the same size in our sky.
              </p>

              <p>
                When the moon eclipse the sun, it casts two types of shadows on
                Earth: a smaller, darker shadow, known as the umbra, and a
                larger shadow, known as the penumbra.

                  <h4>Solar Eclipse</h4>
                </div>
              </div>
              <p>There are four types of solar eclipses:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The first and most spectacular is a <b>total eclipse</b>, when
                  the moon completely covers the sun's surface. A total eclipse
                  can only be seen if you're standing within the umbral shadow.
                  The imaginary line created by umbral shadow as it races across
                  Earth is known as the <b>path of totality</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  People within the penumbral shadow see only a
                  <b>partial eclipse</b>, the second type. From this view,
                  outside the path of totality, the moon passes in front of the
                  sun off-center, never fully covering its surface.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Third, an <b>annular eclipse</b>, occurs when the moon passes
                  directly in front of the sun. However, unlike a total eclipse,
                  the moon appears too small to fully cover the sun. The moon's
                  orbit is elliptical, so sometimes it's closer to Earth
                  (perigee) and sometimes it's farther away (apogee).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Last, a <b>hybrid eclipse</b>, is when the moon's position
                  between the Earth and sun is so finely balanced that the
                  curvature of the Earth plays a role. The moon will be farther
                  away from some parts of Earth along the eclipse's path,
                  resulting in an annular eclipse. In other parts, the moon will
                  be just close enough to fully cover the sun, resulting in a
                  total eclipse.
                </li>

              <p>
                While a total solar eclipse happens somewhere on Earth every
                year or two, any given point on Earth experiences the event only
                about once every 400 years.
              </p>
              <p>
                The moon moves about one and a half inches away from Earth each
                year. It's estimated that in about a billion years, the moon
                will be too far away from Earth to completely cover the sun.

              <h3>Lunar Eclipse</h3>
              <p>
                A lunar eclipse happens when the earth blocks some or all of the
                sun's direct light from reaching the moon. This cosmic event
                only takes place during a full moon, which happens once every 29
                and a half days.
              </p>
              <p>
                When the earth eclipse the sun, it casts two types of shadows on
                the moon, a larger shadow, known as the <b>penumbra</b>, and a
                smaller, darker shadow, known as the <b>umbra</b>.

              </div>
              <p>There are three types of lunar eclipses:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  A <b>total lunar eclipse</b> occurs when the sun, moon, and
                  earth are in perfect alignment and the moon falls within the
                  earth's umbral shadow. They turn the moon a sunset red.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A <b>partial lunar eclipse</b> occurs when the earth, moon,
                  and sun don't perfectly align, so only part of the moon passes
                  into earth's umbra. Earth's shadow appears very dark on the
                  side of the moon facing earth.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Last, a <b>penumbral lunar eclipse</b>, occurs when the moon
                  passes through earth's penumbral shadow. The event is so
                  subtle that most people don't even notice. The moon will
                  appear just slightly darker than normal.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                As the moon inches away from the earth each year, one day,
                billions of years from now, the moon will be too far away to
                fall completely within earth's umbral shadow.
              </p>
              <div class="note">
                <h3 style="text-align: center">
                  Why isn't there an eclipse every month?
                </h3>
                <p>
                  If earth's orbit around the sun and the moon's orbit around
                  the earth were truly lined up perfectly, this would be the
                  case. But the reality is that they're not lined up.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So, if you follow the orbit of the moon as it goes around the
                  Earth, sometimes it's above the plane of the ecliptic and
                  sometimes it's below. So the shadow cast by the moon misses
                  the Earth, or the shadow cast by the Earth misses the moon.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But other times, the sun, moon and Earth are aligned, and we
                  get eclipses. In fact, eclipses tend to come in pairs, with a
                  solar eclipse followed by a lunar eclipse, because everything
                  is nicely aligned.
