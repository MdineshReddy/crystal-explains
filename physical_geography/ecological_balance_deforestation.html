              <h2>Ecological Balance</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                Ecological balance is a state of dynamic equilibrium within a
                community of organisms in a habitat or ecosystem. It can happen
                when the diversity of the living organisms remains relatively
                stable.
              </p>
              <p>
                This balance occurs through competition and cooperation between
                different organisms where population remains stable. For example
                in vast grasslands where the herbivorous animals (deer, zebras,
                buffaloes, etc.) are found in plenty. On the other hand, the
                carnivorous animals (tigers, lions, etc.) that are not usually
                in large numbers, hunt and feed on the herbivores, thereby
                controlling their population.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the plants, any disturbance in the native forests such as
                clearing the forest for shifting cultivation usually brings
                about a change in the species distribution. This change is due
                to competition where the secondary forest species such as
                grasses, bamboos or pines overtakes the native species changing
                the original forest structure. This is called succession.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ecological balance may be disturbed due to the introduction of
                new species, natural hazards or human causes. Human interference
                has affected the balance of plant communities leading to
                disturbances in the ecosystems. Such disturbances bring about
                numerous secondary successions. Human pressure on the earth’s
                resources has put a heavy toll on the ecosystem. This has
                destroyed its originality and has caused adverse effects to the
                general environment. Ecological imbalances have brought many
                natural calamities like floods, landslides, diseases, erratic
                climatic occurrences, etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                There is a very close relationship between the plant and animal
                communities within particular habitats. Diversity of life in a
                particular area can be employed as an indicator of the habitat
                factor. Proper knowledge and understanding of such factors
                provide a strong base for protecting and conserving the
                ecosystems.
              </p>
              <h3>Deforestation</h3>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                Deforestation, or removing trees to use the land for something
                else has caused immense damage to ecosystems, especially in
                tropical rainforest biomes. But indigenous communities have
                figured out a type of calculated clearing that allows them to
                work with the rapid nutrient recycling of tropical rainforest
                biomes.
              </p>
              <p>
                In parts of Asia, Africa, and South America with dense tropical
                forests, many farmers have to rely on a kind of
                <b>subsistence agricultural practice</b>, which means they only
                grow enough food for their families. Staples like rice are grown
                in southeast Asia, maize and cassava in South America, and
                sorghum in Africa. Yams, sugarcane, plantains, and vegetables
                are also planted to supplement staples and to provide fuel and
                fodder for animals.
              </p>
              <p>
                This practice goes by many names, like swidden,
                <b>shifting cultivation</b>, slash-and-burn agriculture and
                Jhumming Cultivation (in India). The farmers begin by cutting
                small areas of tropical forests into slash, or cut vegetation,
                that’s then dried and burned. The ash gets mixed with the soil
                to provide needed minerals and nutrients. After a few years, and
                before the soil is completely exhausted, the farmers move on to
                another part of land and repeat the clearing, burning, and
                planting process.
              </p>
              <div class="img">
                <img
                  src="../images/geography/shifting_cultivation.png"
                  alt="Shifting Cultivation"
                  style="width: 100%"
                />
              </div>
              <p>
                The previous plot is left unplanted, and eventually the forest
                will naturally expand to start using that soil. This land
                rotation is a key part of why humans have been able to keep
                farming like this for thousands of years.
              </p>
              <p>
                But when widespread clear-cutting happens, ecosystems can
                collapse. For example, we've seen this destruction in the Amazon
                when rice, soy, and corn have been commercially cultivated and
                sold in domestic and international markets. The soil is
                exhausted after 3-5 years, so crops can't really grow anymore,
                and then large cattle operations move in. As cattle feed and
                trample the ground, the soils are exposed to plenty of UV
                radiation from sunlight, as well as cycles of wetting and drying
                from precipitation. The soils become a brick-like substance
                called <b>laterite</b>, which isn’t great for growing… so the
                once-lively rainforest basically becomes hard, barren, and
                lifeless.

                Tropical rainforests cover 6 percent of Earth’s landmass, but
                contain 50 percent of the world’s species, many of which haven’t
                been described by science and are critical to the world’s
                biodiversity. But since the 1980s, 1/5 of the Amazon has been
                deforested as we build more towns, roads, dams, farms, and
                mines. Across the Atlantic, deforestation in Ituri in the Congo
                Basin, the world’s second largest expanse of equatorial
                rainforest, is endangering the mountain gorilla. And in
                southeast Asia clearcutting for palm oil plantations endanger
                orangutans, Sumatran tigers, and Sumatran elephants.

                When humans disturb the biosphere, we alter how energy flows and
                how nutrients cycle, which can throw off entire ecosystems in
                unexpected ways. But we can take care of the world around us and
                the much bigger ecosystems we're a part of. Learning where our
                food comes from and how it’s produced is a good first step, like
                by supporting farmers who try to grow food sustainably. We also
                have to hold governments and corporations responsible for the
                policies and large-scale deforestation that affect entire
                ecosystem.
