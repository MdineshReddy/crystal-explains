              <h1 class="title">Plate Tectonics</h1>
              <p>
                Plate tectonics is a scientific theory that explains how major
                landforms are created as a result of Earth’s subterranean
                movements. It is a revolutionary theory as it provides a uniform
                context for understanding all the dynamics of lithosphere like
                mountain-building processes, volcanoes, and earthquakes as well
                as the evolution of Earth’s surface and helps in reconstructing
                its past continents and oceans.
              </p>
              <p>
                In plate tectonics, Earth’s outermost layer, or lithosphere
                (crust and upper mantle) is broken into large rocky plates.
                These plates lie on top of a partially molten layer of rock
                called the asthenosphere. Due to the convection of the
                asthenosphere and lithosphere, the plates move relative to each
                other at different rates, from 2 to 15 centimeters per year.
                This interaction of tectonic plates is responsible for many
                different geological formations such as the Himalaya mountain
                range in Asia, the East African Rift, and the San Andreas Fault
                in California, United States.
              </p>
              <h2>Background of the Plate Tectonics Theory</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                Around the start of the twentieth century, various theorists
                unsuccessfully attempted to explain the many geographical,
                geological, and biological continuities between continents.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 1912 the meteorologist <b>Alfred Wegener</b> described what
                he called <b>continental drift</b>, an idea that culminated
                fifty years later in the modern theory of plate tectonics.
              </p>
              <h3>continental Drift Theory</h3>
              <p>
                Continental Drift Theory states that present continents once
                formed a single super continent, called <b>Pangea</b> surrounded
                by a super ocean called <b>Panthalassa</b>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Around 200 million years ago (Mesozoic Era), the super
                continent, Pangaea, began to split. Pangaea first broke into two
                large continental masses as Laurasia and Gondwanaland forming
                the northern and southern components respectively. Subsequently,
                Laurasia and Gondwanaland continued to break into various
                smaller continents that exist today.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b> Evidence Supporting Continental Drift Theory: </b>
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>The Matching of Continents (Jig-Saw-Fit)</b>: The
                  shorelines of Africa and South America facing each other have
                  a remarkable and unmistakable match.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b> Rocks of Same Age Across the Oceans:</b> The radiometric
                  dating of a belt of ancient rocks of 2,000 million years from
                  Brazil coast matches with those from western Africa. The
                  earliest marine deposits along the coastline of South America
                  and Africa are of the Jurassic age. This suggests that the
                  ocean did not exist prior to that time.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Tillite:</b> a sedimentary rock formed out of deposits of
                  glaciers is commonly found in India, Africa, Madagascar,
                  Antarctica and Australia which were all once part of Gondwana
                  system.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Placer Deposits</b>: The occurrence of rich placer deposits
                  of gold in the Ghana coast and the absolute absence of source
                  rock in the region is an amazing fact. The gold bearing veins
                  are in Brazil and it is speculated that the gold deposits of
                  the Ghana are derived from the Brazil plateau when the two
                  continents lay side by side.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b> Distribution of Fossils</b>: The fossils discovered of
                  identical species of plants and animals on landmasses
                  separated by oceans led some to consider a single contiguous
                  landmass existed.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                <b>Force for Drifting:</b> Wegener suggested that the movement
                responsible for the drifting of the continents was caused by
                pole-fleeing force (<i>Polflucht</i> in German). He suggested
                that a differential gravitational force (near equator and poles)
                would cause continental masses to drift slowly from poles
                towards the equator. But this force is now known to be far too
                weak and the Polflucht hypothesis was found to be implausible.
                Another explanation lies in the different forces generated by
                tidal forces of the Sun and Moon, which again is not proven to
                have continent-moving strength.
              </p>
              <p>
                Although now accepted, the theory of continental drift was once
                widely ridiculed, rejected and soon, mostly, forgotten. Wegener
                never lived to see his theory accepted—he died at the age of 50
                in 1930 while on an expedition in Greenland.

                <b> Arthur Holmes and Convectional Current Theory </b>
              </p>
              <p>
                British geologist Arthur Holmes breathed new life into the
                theory of continental drift by providing an explanation to the
                issue of force, on the basis of which contemporary scientists
                discarded the theory.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 1931, he discussed the possibility of convection currents
                operating in the mantle portion. These currents are generated
                due to radioactive elements causing thermal differences in the
                mantle portion. Holmes proposed that entire Earth's mantle
                contained convection cells that dissipated radioactive heat and
                moved the crust at the surface.
              </p>
              <p>
                His theory was the origin of the seafloor spreading concept.

              <h3>Seafloor Spreading</h3>
              <p>
                In the 1950s and 1960s, new data began to support the idea of
                continental drift. This theory called Seafloor Spreading
                proposed by American geologist named Harry Hess, build up on
                Convectional Current Theory of Arthur Holmes.
              </p>
              <p></p>
              <p>
                Maps of the ocean floor showed massive undersea mountain ranges,
                also called <b>Mid-Oceanic Ridges</b>. They occur at divergent
                plate boundaries (more on that later). As tectonic plates slowly
                move away from each other, heat from the mantle’s convection
                currents weakens the crust and makes it less dense.
              </p>
              <p>
                Eventually, the crust cracks. Hot magma from the asthenosphere,
                fueled by mantle convection, bubbles up to fill these fractures
                and spills onto the crust often forming a mountain or elevated
                area of the seafloor. This bubbled-up magma is cooled by frigid
                seawater to form igneous rock. This rock (basalt) becomes a new
                part of Earth’s oceanic crust.

                <b> Geomagnetic Reversals </b>
              </p>
              <p>
                The magnetism of mid-ocean ridges helped scientists first
                identify the process of seafloor spreading in the early 20th
                century. Basalt, the once-molten rock that makes up most new
                oceanic crust, is a fairly magnetic substance, and scientists
                began using magnetometers to measure the magnetism of the ocean
                floor in the 1950s.
              </p>
              <p>
                What they discovered was that the magnetism of the ocean floor
                around mid-ocean ridges was divided into matching “stripes” on
                either side of the ridge. Scientists determined that the same
                process formed the perfectly symmetrical stripes on both side of
                a mid-ocean ridge. The continual process of seafloor spreading
                separated the stripes in an orderly pattern.
              </p>
              <p>
                Magnetic data from the ocean floor and the relatively young age
                of oceanic crust supported Hess’s hypothesis of seafloor
                spreading.

              <h2>Plate Tectonics Theory</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                Plate Tectonics Theory explains why Earth’s continents are
                moving; the theory of continental drift did not provide a
                practical explanation. Therefore, the theory of plate tectonics
                is more complete.
              </p>
              <p>
                The force required for plate movements is given from convective
                cell theory of Arthur Holmes. In fact, Seafloor spreading is
                just one part of plate tectonics (take a look at divergent
                boundary below).
              </p>
              <p>
                In this theory, lithosphere (the crust and upper mantle), is
                broken into tectonic plates. The Earth's lithosphere is composed
                of seven or eight major plates and many minor plates. Where the
                plates meet, their relative motion determines the type of
                boundary: convergent, divergent, or transform.
              </p>
              <p>
                Earthquakes, volcanic activity, mountain-building, and oceanic
                trench formation occur along these plate boundaries (or faults).
              </p>
              <h3>Major Plates</h3>
              <p>
                These plates comprise the bulk of the continents and the Pacific
                Ocean. For purposes of this list, a major plate is any plate
                with an area greater than 20 million km<sup>2</sup>.

              <h3>Types of Plate Boundaries</h3>
              <p>
                There are three types of plate boundaries: convergent,
                divergent, and transform.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b> Convergent Boundary (or) Destructive Boundary </b>
              </p>
              <p>
                A Convergent Boundary forms when two (or more) tectonic plates
                collide and one plate eventually slides beneath the other, a
                process known as subduction. The location where sinking of a
                plate occurs is called a <b>subduction zone</b>.
              </p>
              <p>
                At subduction zones, the edge of the denser plate subducts, or
                slides, beneath the less-dense one. The denser lithospheric
                material then melts back into the Earth's mantle.
              </p>
              <p>
                These collision can lead to volcanism, earthquakes, orogenesis,
                destruction of lithosphere, and deformation.

              <p>
                A Divergent Boundary forms when two tectonic plates that are
                moving away from each other. The sites where the plates move
                away from each other are called <b>spreading sites</b>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Divergent boundaries within continents initially produce rifts,
                which eventually become rift valleys. Most active divergent
                plate boundaries occur between oceanic plates and exist as
                mid-oceanic ridges. Divergent boundaries also form volcanic
                islands, which occur when the plates move apart to produce gaps
                that magma rises to fill.

                <p>
                  The Indian plate includes Peninsular India and the Australian
                  continental portions. The Tethys Sea separated it from the
                  Asian continent till about 225 million years ago. India is
                  supposed to have started her northward journey about 200
                  million years ago at the time when Pangaea broke.
                </p>
                <p>
                  During the movement of the Indian plate towards the Eurasian
                  plate, a major event that occurred was the outpouring of lava
                  and formation of the Deccan Traps. This started somewhere
                  around 60 million years ago and continued for a long period of
                  time.
                </p>
                <p>
                  India collided with Asia about 40-50 million years ago causing
                  rapid uplift of the Himalayas. Scientists believe that the
                  process is still continuing and the height of the Himalayas is
                  rising even to this date.
