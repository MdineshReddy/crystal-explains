              <p>
                Earthquakes and Volcanoes are the two frequently occuring
                natural hazards with tremendous destructive potential. They are
                both caused by the sudden and Catastropic
                <a href='/physical_geography/geomorphic_processes.html'>Endogenic Forces</a>.
              </p>
              <h2>Earthquakes</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                An earthquake is the shaking of the surface of the Earth,
                resulting from a sudden release of energy in the Earth's
                lithosphere that creates seismic waves.
              </p>
              <p>Majority of the earthquakes takes place in three regions:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The Mid-Atlantic Ridge, an underwater line that runs down the
                  Atlantic Ocean.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Alpide belt which stretches from the Mediterranean to
                  Southeast Asia.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Circum-Pacific Belt (or Pacific Ring of Fire) which traces
                  along the edges of the Pacific Ocean.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <div class="img bigimg">
                <img

                  alt="Major Earthquake Zones"

              </div>
              <h3>Causes</h3>
              <p>
                Earthquakes are the result of pressure caused by extreme stress
                in the Earth's crust. That stress can be caused by volcanic
                activity or even man-made activities in certain areas.
              </p>
              <p>
                However most earthquake inducing stress is caused by the
                movement of tectonic plates. (<a href='/physical_geography/plate_tectonics.html'>read more on plate tectonics</a
                >). Tectonic Plates are constantly moving either against
                (convergent), away (divergent), along (transform) or underneath
                each other (subduction).
              </p>
              <p>
                But sometimes Plate edges may catch and stick. The plates
                however continue to move or at least attempt to move. Energy
                from this attempted movement builds around the edges sticking
                point, creating immense pressure until the edges are forced to
                let go and the plates slip. This causes a sudden and powerful
                release of energy. So powerful, that it breaks the Earth's
                crust. This fracturing emits shockwaves through the ground and
                causes intense vibrations or quakes.
              </p>
              <p>
                The point inside the earth, where the energy is released is
                called the <b>focus or hypocentre</b>. The energy waves
                travelling in different directions reach the surface. The point
                on the surface, nearest i.e., directly above the focus, is
                called <b>Epicentre</b>.

                  Richter Scale vs Mercalli Scale vs Moment Magnitude Scale

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    The intensity of an earthquake is measured by Mercalli
                    scale. It is measured by observation of the effects on
                    earth’s surface, humans, objects and man-made structures.
                    Its scale ranges from I (not felt) to XII (total
                    destruction).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The magnitude of earthquake is given by Richter scale. It is
                    given by measuring the seismic waves that cause the
                    earthquake using a Seismograph. Its scale range from 2.0 to
                    10.0+ (never recorded).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The Mercalli scale is linear. The Richter scale is
                    logarithmic meaning a magnitude 5 earthquake is ten times as
                    intense as a magnitude 4 earthquake.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  <b>Moment Magnitude Scale</b> is similar to Richter Scale, in
                  that it is also logarithmic. But Moment Magnitude Scale has no
                  upper limit and can be applied globally to measure quakes of
                  the highest magnitudes.

                  <b>Valdivia earthquake</b>, occurred near Bolivia Chile in
                  1960 nestled within the circum-pacific belt. Measuring 9.4–9.6
                  on the moment magnitude scale, in addition to causing
                  devastating tremors on land, it also generated a deadly
                  tsunami reaching up to 80 feet high. The tsunami raced across
                  the Pacific Ocean hitting faraway countries like the
                  Philippines and Japan.

              <h3>Types of Earthquake or Seismic Waves</h3>
              <p>
                Earthquake or Seismic waves are the energy waves generated
                during earthquakes. They travel through the earth in all
                directions from the focus and are recorded on Seismographs. They
                are broadly divided into two types: body waves and surface
                waves.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b> Body Waves </b>: Traveling through the interior of the
                earth, body waves arrive before the surface waves. These waves
                are of a higher frequency than surface waves. They are again
                classified into following types:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>P waves or Primary waves</b> are the fastest body waves and
                  the first to 'arrive' at a seismic station. They can move
                  through solid rock and fluids, like water or the liquid layers
                  of the earth. It pushes and pulls the rock as it moves and
                  hence P Waves are also called <b>compressional waves</b>.
                  Subjected to a P wave, particles move in the same direction
                  that the wave is moving in, which is the direction that the
                  energy is traveling in, and is sometimes called the 'direction
                  of wave propagation'.

                </div>
                <li>
                  <b>S waves or secondary waves</b> are the second wave you feel
                  in an earthquake. An S wave is slower than a P wave and can
                  only move through solid rock, not through any liquid medium.
                  It is this property of S waves that led seismologists to
                  conclude that the Earth's outer core is a liquid. S waves move
                  rock particles up and down, or side-to-side. Subjected to a S
                  wave, particles move in the perpendicular to the direction
                  that the wave is traveling in (the direction of wave
                  propagation).
                </li>
              </ul>

              </div>
              <p>
                <b>Surface Waves</b>: are of a lower frequency than body waves,
                and are easily distinguished on a seismograph as a result.
                Though they arrive after body waves, it is surface waves that
                are almost enitrely responsible for the damage and destruction
                associated with earthquakes. They are classified as following:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Love Waves:</b> It's the fastest surface wave and moves the
                  ground from side-to-side. Confined to the surface of the
                  crust, Love waves produce entirely horizontal motion.

                </div>
                <li>
                  <b>Rayleigh Waves:</b> rolls along the ground just like a wave
                  rolls across a lake or an ocean. Because it rolls, it moves
                  the ground up and down, and side-to-side in the same direction
                  that the wave is moving. Most of the shaking felt from an
                  earthquake is due to the Rayleigh wave, which can be much
                  larger than the other waves.

              <h3>Shadow Zone</h3>
              <p>
                Earthquake waves get recorded in seismographs located at far off
                locations. However, there exist some specific areas where the
                waves are not reported. Such a zone is called the ‘shadow zone’.
                The study of different events reveals that for each earthquake,
                there exists an altogether different shadow zone. It was
                observed that seismographs,
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  located within 105° from the epicentre, recorded the arrival
                  of both P and S-waves.
                </li>
                <li>
                  between 105° and 145° from epicentre both the waves are not
                  recorded.
                </li>
                <li>beyond 145° from epicentre, only P-Waves are recorded.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Thus, The shadow zone of S-wave is much larger than that of the
                P-waves.

              <h2>Volcanoes</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                A volcano is an opening on the surface of the Earth that allows
                hot lava, volcanic ash, and gases to escape from a magma chamber
                below the surface.
              </p>
              <p>
                Volcanoes are scattered across the planet. Most volcanoes
                whether on land or underwater are located where tectonic plates
                meet. The Pacific Ring of Fire, a path that traces the
                boundaries between several tectonic plates around the Pacific
                Ocean contains about 75% of the planets volcanoes.
              </p>
              <p>
                Volcanoes occur at both diverging or converging plate
                boundaries. For example, a mid-oceanic ridge, such as the
                Mid-Atlantic Ridge, has volcanoes caused by divergent tectonic
                plates whereas the Pacific Ring of Fire has volcanoes caused by
                convergent tectonic plates. Volcanoes are usually not created
                where two tectonic plates slide past one another (transform
                boundary).

              <h3>Volcanic Eruption</h3>
              <p>
                All Active volcanoes emit gas and molten rock. The journey of
                these emissions begins deep underground in the Earth's core. The
                core which can burn as hot as the surface of the Sun, transfers
                its heat to the surrounding rocky mantle.
              </p>
              <p>
                In doing so, the heat melts some of the rock in the mantle. This
                molten rock or magma is lighter than the surrounding solid rock
                layer. So it rises through the mantle. The magma then escapes
                through vents in the Earth's crust, causing volcanic eruptions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now above-ground this magma is referred to as <b>lava</b> and it
                can reach temperatures of over 1000 degree C. In addition to
                lava, volcanoes may erupt with searing hot gas formed in the
                mantle in a phenomenon called <b>pyroclastic flow</b>. This gas
                combined with hot ash can race down the sides of a volcano as
                fast as 100 miles per hour burning everything in its path.

              <h3>Classification Of Volcanoes</h3>
              <p>
                Based on their shape and size, volcanoes are mainly classified
                as:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Strato-Volcanoes</b> which often appear as tall steep
                  mountains. Ex: Mount Fuji in Japan, Mayon Volcano in the
                  Philippines, and Mount Vesuvius and Stromboli in Italy.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Shield Volcanoes:</b>
                  which are flatter and dome shaped. Ex: Mauna Loa in Hawaii,
                  USA.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Calderas: </b> which are large depressions in the ground.
                  Ex: Mount Bromo in Indonesia.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b> Mid Ocean Ridges:</b> which are underwater chains of
                  volcanic mountains.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                On the basis of history of their Eruptions, volcanoes are
                classified as:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Acitve Volcanoes</b> that errupt frequently or those that
                  have erupted in recent times. Ex: Kīlauea in Hawaii, Mt. Etna
                  and Stromboli in Italy and volcanoes in Pacific "Ring of
                  Fire".
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Dormant Volcanoes:</b> that have been known to erupt in
                  past and show signs of possible eruptions in future. Ex: Mt.
                  Kilimanjaro in Tanzania and Narcondam islands in Andaman.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Extinct Volcano:</b> that have not erupted in the past
                  10,000 years. They no longer have lava supply.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <div class="note">
                <p>
                  While volcanoes are some of the most destructive forces of
                  nature, they are also useful. Volcanic ash provides nutrients
                  to nearby soil making the land fertile and lava when it cools
                  hardens into rock and creates new landforms.
