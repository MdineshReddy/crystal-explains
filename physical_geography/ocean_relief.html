              <h1 class="title">Ocean Relief</h1>
              <p>
                Oceans are confined to the great depressions of the earth’s
                outer layer. Oceans, unlike the continents, merge so naturally
                into one another that it is hard to demarcate them. The
                geographers have divided the oceanic part of the earth into five
                oceans, namely the Pacific, the Atlantic, the Indian, Southern
                ocean and the Arctic. The various seas, bays, gulfs and other
                inlets are parts of these five large oceans.
              </p>
              <p>
                A major portion of the ocean floor is found between 3-6 km below
                the sea level. The ‘land’ under the waters of the oceans, that
                is, the <b>ocean floor</b> exhibits complex and varied features
                as those observed over the land.
              </p>
              <p>
                The floors of the oceans are rugged with the world’s largest
                mountain ranges, deepest trenches and the largest plains. These
                features are formed, like those of the continents, by the
                factors of tectonic, volcanic and depositional processes.
              </p>

                  alt="Major Relief Features"

                />
              </div>
              <h2>Major Relief Features or Divisions of the Ocean Floors</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>The ocean floors can be divided into four major divisions:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>the Continental Shelf;</li>
                <li>the Continental Slope;</li>
                <li>the Deep Sea Plain or Abyssal Plains;</li>
                <li>the Oceanic Deeps.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Continental Shelf</h3>
              <p>
                The continental shelf is the extended margin of each continent
                occupied by relatively shallow seas and gulfs. It is the
                shallowest part of the ocean showing an average gradient of 1°
                or even less. The shelf typically ends at a very steep slope,
                called the <b>shelf break</b>.
              </p>
              <p>
                The width of the continental shelves vary from one ocean to
                another. The average width of continental shelves is about 80
                km. The shelves are almost absent or very narrow along some of
                the margins like the coasts of Chile, the west coast of Sumatra,
                etc. On the contrary, the Siberian shelf in the Arctic Ocean is
                the largest shelf in the world, stretches to 1,500 km in width.
                The depth of the shelves also varies. It may be as shallow as 30
                m in some areas while in some areas it is as deep as 600 m.
              </p>
              <p>
                The continental shelves are covered with variable thicknesses of
                sediments brought down by rivers, glaciers, wind, from the land
                and distributed by waves and currents. Massive sedimentary
                deposits received over a long time by the continental shelves,
                become the source of fossil fuels.
              </p>
              <h3>Continental Slope</h3>
              <p>
                The continental slope begins where the bottom of the continental
                shelf sharply drops off into a steep slope. The gradient of the
                slope region varies between 2-5°. The depth of the slope region
                varies between 200 and 3,000 m. The slope boundary indicates the
                end of the continents. Canyons and trenches are observed in this
                region.
              </p>
              <h3>Deep Sea Plain or Abyssal Plains</h3>
              <p>
                Deep sea plains are gently sloping areas of the ocean basins.
                These are the flattest and smoothest regions of the world. The
                depths vary between 3,000 and 6,000m. These plains are covered
                with fine-grained sediments like clay and silt.
              </p>
              <h3>Oceanic Deeps or Trenches</h3>
              <p>
                These areas are the deepest parts of the oceans. The trenches
                are relatively steep sided, narrow basins. They are some 3-5 km
                deeper than the surrounding ocean floor. They occur at the bases
                of continental slopes and are associated with active volcanoes
                and strong earthquakes. That is why they are very significant in
                the study of plate movements.

              <div class="underline"></div>
              <h3>Mid-Oceanic Ridges</h3>
              <p>
                A mid-oceanic ridge is composed of two chains of mountains
                separated by a large depression. The mountain ranges can have
                peaks as high as 2,500 m and some even reach above the ocean’s
                surface.
              </p>
              <h3>Submarine Canyons</h3>
              <p>
                These are deep valleys, some comparable to the Grand Canyon of
                the Colorado river. They are sometimes found cutting across the
                continental shelves and slopes, often extending from the mouths
                of large rivers. The Hudson Canyon is the best known submarine
                canyon.
              </p>
              <h3>Seamount</h3>
              <p>
                It is a mountain with pointed summits, rising from the seafloor
                that does not reach the surface of the ocean. Seamounts are
                volcanic in origin. These can be 3,000-4,500 m tall. The Emperor
                seamount, an extension of the Hawaiian Islands in the Pacific
                Ocean, is a good example.
              </p>

              <h3>Guyots</h3>
              <p>
                It is a flat topped seamount. They show evidences of gradual
                subsidence through stages to become flat topped submerged
                mountains. It is estimated that more than 10,000 seamounts and
                guyots exist in the Pacific Ocean alone.
              </p>
              <h3>Atoll</h3>
              <p>
                These are low islands found in the oceans consisting of land of
                small width and coral reefs surrounding a central depression. It
                may be a part of the sea (lagoon), or sometimes form enclosing a
                body of fresh, brackish, or highly saline water.

                When we look at the sheer scale of the Earth's oceans, it's hard
                to believe that less than 2% of all biomass on Earth lives
                there. And of that small percentage, around 90% is located close
                to the surface in the first 200 meters. This is where we begin
                our journey. Here, light can still penetrate the water which
                allows photosynthesis to occur. Phytoplankton, trillions and
                trillions of single-celled algae and bacteria make up the
                foundation of the ocean's ecosystem, and they're consumed by
                bigger plankton, who are consumed by other species. The seafloor
                at this depth is often covered with coral reefs and other sea
                plants that are home to a plethora of sea animals.

                Moving from familiar coastal waters into deeper, more remote
                waters, we eventually reach the edge of the
                <b>continental shelf</b>, where we're confronted with the
                <b>continental slope</b>, the long descent down to the deep sea.
                With every additional metre of water, light fades drastically,
                which means there are basically no more plants.
              </p>
              <p>
                Let's leave the slope behind us, and enter what's known as the
                <b>twilight zone</b>, the portal to the deep sea. As we sink
                down further, the water pressure rises to deadly levels. The
                deepest scuba dive ever came in at 332 meters. At that depth,
                the pressure is like having 200 cars stacked on top of you. Yet
                we've only completed 3% of our journey. In this transition zone
                between twilight and darkness, light becomes a powerful tool.
                Over 90% of the species indigenous to this deep environment use
                bioluminescence chemicals to create light. They do so as
                camouflage against the very faint sunlight, to confuse and scare
                attackers or, they use lights to hunt.

                Another tool for survival in the dark is teamwork. At around 700
                metres, we encounter a colony of siphonophores. They can be up
                to 50 metres in length, but are only as wide as a broomstick. To
                attract prey, a colony creates a tragically beautiful bright
                blue or red light, and deploys a curtain of tentacles filled
                with toxic needles that kill anything that comes too close.

                As we reach 1,000 meters, deeper than the tallest structure
                built by humans, we reach the <b>midnight zone</b>, a place of
                utter darkness. A barely explored wet wasteland consisting of
                nothing but endless black open water. At these depths, it's
                harder for a human to take a swim than to take a walk in space.
              </p>
              <p>
                We sink further, below the 3,800 meters, as deep as the grave of
                the Titanic. We are now at <b>abyssal depths</b>. Here, life
                happens in slow motion. Preserving every last bit of energy is
                crucial for survival. Everything down here hovers motionless, or
                swims in a slow, elegant fashion. The only time the animals
                living in this zone move fast is when they have to escape
                danger. Like the Dumbo octopod paddling with its ear-like fins,
                or the grenadiers fish with its slow, eel-like tail beats.
              </p>
              <p>
                At 4,000 meters, we finally reach ground again: the
                <b>abyssal plain</b>. It's covered in grey mud and rocks dusted
                with the remains of marine snow, which is consumed by animals
                like sea cucumbers, shrimp, sea urchins, and sea worms. In some
                regions of the seafloor, small, dark mineral deposits like
                manganese nodules can be seen. In the rift valleys, where
                tectonic plates are splitting apart, magma heats up seawater and
                creates dark jets of water and minerals as hot as 400℃ that form
                elaborate chimneys and towers. Extremophile bacteria use the
                minerals to create organic substances that are the bases for
                unique ecosystems.
              </p>
              <p>
                As we descend further, we reach the deepest point of the abyssal
                plain at 6,000 meters. For most of the seafloor, this is as deep
                as it gets, but if we want to get to the deepest point of the
                oceans, we're actually only halfway there.
              </p>
              <p>
                Let's enter the <b>hadal zone</b>, the underworld of the sea. It
                consists of long narrow trenches that only make up around 0.25%
                of the oceans, and are among the most extreme environments on
                Earth. Only extremophiles exist down here, like the ethereal
                snailfish, that holds the record for the deepest living fish
                ever seen, at around 8,000 meters.
              </p>
              <p>
                And at 11,000 meters, we reach the final slope, a trench inside
                the larger <b>Mariana Trench</b> with gently-sloping sides that
                enframe a valley about 1.6 kilometers wide. The water pressure
                here is 1,086 bar. This is the deepest point on earth,
                <b>the Challenger Deep</b>. Taking a swim here is like having to
                balance 1,800 elephants on top of you. But even here, life has
                found a way to thrive like the sea cucumbers, white and light
                pink amphipods. Their size is astounding. While their
                shallow-water cousins are merely a few centimetres long, the
                deep-sea version can reach up to 30 centimeters.
