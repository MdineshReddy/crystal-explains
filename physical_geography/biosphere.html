              <h1 class="title">Biosphere</h1>
              <p>
                Having looked at the three major realms of the environment, that
                is, the lithosphere, the atmosphere and the hydrosphere, we have
                arrived at the final realm, the biosphere -- the sphere of life
                that extends from the depths of the ocean all the way up to 8
                kilometers above Earth. A lot of incredible things live here.
              </p>
              <h3>Ecosystem</h3>
              <p>
                The environment is made up of <b>abiotic</b> and
                <b>biotic</b> components. These biotic and abiotic components
                are linked together through nutrient cycles and energy flows.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The living things like plants and animals and bacteria (or
                  their dead bodies) are the biotic parts.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The nonliving things like the soil, atmosphere, and
                  groundwater are the abiotic parts.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                A balance is to be maintained in a particular proportion so that
                a healthy interaction between the biotic and the abiotic
                components goes on.
              </p>
              <p>
                The interactions of a particular group of organisms with abiotic
                factors within a particular habitat resulting in clearly defined
                energy flows and material cycles on land, water and air, are
                called <b>ecological systems</b> or simply <b>Ecosystems</b>.
              </p>
              <h3>Types of Ecosystems</h3>
              <p>Ecosystems are of two major types: terrestrial and aquatic.</p>
              <p>
                <b>Terrestrial ecosystem</b>
              </p>
              <p>
                Terrestrial ecosystem can be further be classified into
                <b>‘biomes’</b>. A biome is a plant and animal community that
                covers a large geographical area. The boundaries of different
                biomes on land are determined mainly by climate.
              </p>
              <p>
                Therefore, a biome can be defined as the total assemblage of
                plant and animal species interacting within specific conditions.
                These include rainfall, temperature, humidity and soil
                conditions. Some of the major biomes of the world are: forest,
                grassland, desert and tundra biomes.
              </p>
              <div class="img bigimg">
                <img
                  src="../images/geography/biomes.png"
                  alt="Global Biomes"
                  style="width: 100%"
                />
              </div>
              <p>
                The equator gets the most direct sunlight and a lot of
                precipitation, so there’s a lot of photosynthesis happening
                here. These highly productive ecosystems are all tropical
                rainforest biomes, which are some of the most diverse and
                complex areas of the planet.
              </p>
              <div class="note">
                <b>productivity</b> in this context means the ability to produce
                food.
              </div>
              <p>
                There’s less and less precipitation as we move out from the
                equator, and less and less productivity because photosynthesis
                can't happen without water. The biomes gradually shift from
                tropical rainforests to tropical savanna to desert.
              </p>
              <p>
                Further north, in temperate and high latitudes, the productivity
                varies seasonally. Like one biome is the broadleaf deciduous
                forests with oak, beech, hickory, maple, elm and chestnut trees.
                These trees have increased productivity in the sunny spring and
                summer, and shed their leaves in the cooler fall and winter
                seasons. In the middle of continents, there are temperate
                grassland biomes with rich soils that produce the tall grass of
                prairies and the shortgrass of steppe climates.
              </p>
              <p>
                Further north where there are poorer soils and colder climates,
                we meet the boreal forest biomes, which have mainly evergreen
                pine, spruce, fir and larch trees.
              </p>
              <p>
                At even higher latitudes, the decreasing temperatures give us
                the icy tundra biome with no trees and very little productivity.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b> Aquatic ecosystems </b>
              </p>
              <p>
                Aquatic ecosystems can be classed as marine and freshwater
                ecosystems.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Marine ecosystem includes the oceans, estuaries and coral
                  reefs.
                </li>

                  Coral reefs is an underwater ecosystem characterized by
                  reef-building corals. Reefs are formed of colonies of coral
                  polyps held together by calcium carbonate. They are most
                  commonly found at shallow depths in tropical waters, but deep
                  water and cold water coral reefs exist on smaller scales in
                  other areas. The <b>Great Barrier Reef in Australia</b> is the
                  largest coral reef with area stretching about 344,400 square
                  kilometres.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Sometimes called <b>rainforests of the sea</b>, shallow coral
                  reefs form some of Earth's most diverse ecosystems. They
                  occupy less than 0.1% of the world's ocean area, about half
                  the area of France, yet they provide a home for at least 25%
                  of all marine species.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Coral reefs are fragile, partly because they are sensitive to
                  water conditions. Corals respond to stress by "bleaching".
                  They are under threat from excess nutrients (nitrogen and
                  phosphorus), rising temperatures, oceanic acidification,
                  overfishing, sunscreen use, and harmful land-use practices
                  (like building tourist resorts near to sensitive coral
                  reeves).

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Energy flows are the paths energy can take through an
                  ecosystem. Energy generally enters ecosystems from the Sun but
                  doesn’t return to the Sun -- hence the energy flow is an
                  unidirectional and an one-way relationship.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Plants are the primary producers. They absorb the Sun's energy
                  during photosynthesis, adding carbon dioxide and water to make
                  carbohydrates and grow bigger. So the Sun's energy is
                  converted into chemical energy, which is stored in
                  <b>biomass</b> -- any plant or other living thing.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If a bit of biomass is eaten, it passes on its chemical energy
                  to continue the energy flow. The primary consumers include
                  herbivorous animals like rabbits, deer, goats, mice and all
                  plant-eating animals.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Secondary Consumers are the carnivores which include all
                  the flesh-eating animals like snakes, tigers and lions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Certain carnivores that feed also on carnivores are known as
                  top carnivores or Teritiary carnivores like hawks and
                  mongooses.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Decomposers are those that feed on dead organisms (for
                  example, scavengers like vultures and crows and bacteria and
                  various micro-organisms), and further break down dead matter
                  into nutrients, like nitrogen gas.
                </li>

                <b>Food Chain:</b> A plant eating beetle feeding on a paddy
                stalk is eaten by a frog, which is, in turn, eaten by a snake,
                which is then consumed by a hawk. This sequence of eating and
                being eaten and the resultant transfer of energy from one level
                to another is known as the food-chain.

              <h2>Nutrients Cycle</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                A nutrient cycle (or ecological recycling) is the cyclical
                movement of nutrients in an ecosystem. Energy flow is a
                unidirectional and noncyclic pathway, whereas the movement of
                mineral nutrients is cyclic.
              </p>
              <p>
                Nutrient cycles include the carbon cycle, nitrogen cycle, water
                cycle, oxygen cycle, among others that continually recycle along
                with other mineral nutrients into productive ecological
                nutrition.
              </p>
              <h3>Carbon Cycle</h3>
              <p>
                Carbon is one of the basic elements of all living organisms. It
                forms the basic constituent of all the organic compounds. The
                carbon cycle is mainly the conversion of carbon dioxide.
              </p>
              <p>
                This conversion is initiated by the fixation of carbon dioxide
                from the atmosphere through photosynthesis. Such conversion
                results in the production of carbohydrate, glucose that may be
                converted to other organic compounds such as sucrose, starch,
                cellulose, etc. Here, some of the carbohydrates are utilised
                directly by the plant itself. During this process, more carbon
                dioxide is generated and is released through its leaves or roots
                during the day.
              </p>
              <p>
                The remaining carbohydrates not being utilised by the plant
                become part of the plant tissue. Plant tissues are either being
                eaten by the herbivorous animals or get decomposed by the
                micro-organisms. The herbivores convert some of the consumed
                carbohydrates into carbon dioxide for release into the air
                through respiration. The micro-organisms decompose the remaining
                carbohydrates after the animal dies. The carbohydrates that are
                decomposed by the micro-organisms then get oxidised into carbon
                dioxide and are returned to the atmosphere.

              </div>
              <h3>Nitrogen Cycle</h3>
              <p>
                Nitrogen is a major constituent of the atmosphere comprising
                about 78% of the atmospheric gases. It is also an essential
                constituent of different organic compounds such as the amino
                acids, nucleic acids, proteins, vitamins and pigments.
              </p>
              <p>
                Generally, nitrogen is usable only after it is fixed. The
                principal source of free nitrogen is the action of soil
                micro-organisms in the associated plant roots. Nitrogen can also
                be fixed in the atmosphere by lightning and cosmic radiation.
              </p>
              <p>
                After atmospheric nitrogen has been fixed into an available
                form, green plants can assimilate it. Herbivorous animals
                feeding on plants, in turn, consume some of it. Dead plants and
                animals, excretion of nitrogenous wastes are converted into
                nitrites by the action of bacteria present in the soil.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some bacteria can even convert nitrites into nitrates that can
                be used again by green plants. There are still other types of
                bacteria capable of converting nitrates into free nitrogen, a
                process known as denitrification.

              <h3>Oxygen Cycle</h3>
              <p>
                Oxygen is the main by-product of photosynthesis. Oxygen is taken
                up by living organisms in the process of respiration and release
                carbon dioxide which is used for photosynthesis by plants.
              </p>
              <h3>Water Cycle or Hydrologic Cycle</h3>
              <p>
                The water cycle or hydrological cycle refers to the continuous
                exchange of water within the hydrosphere, the atmosphere, soil
                water, surface water, groundwater, and plants in different forms
                i.e. the liquid, solid and the gaseous phases. The water cycle
                has been working for billions of years and all the life on earth
                depends on it.
