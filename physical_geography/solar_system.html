              <p>Our Solar System consists of:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The Sun, eight planets and their respective satellites
                  (moons).
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Dwarf planets which are celestial objects that are too
                  small to be considered a planet but too large to fall under
                  smaller categories. Examples: Pluto, Makemake and Haumea
                  orbits in Kuiper Belt, Ceres orbits in asteroid belt between
                  Mars and Jupiter, and Eris is the farthest with 68
                  astronomical units away from the Sun.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Interstellar debris such as asteroids, meteoroids, comets:
                </li>
                <ul style="list-style-type: square; margin: 0">
                  <li>
                    <b>Asteroids/Planetoids</b> are the rocky and airless
                    leftovers from the formation of planets in our solar system.
                    They mostly orbit our sun in the asteroid belt between Mars
                    and Jupiter and range from the size of cars to dwarf
                    planets. <b>Ceres</b> is the only asteroid large enough to
                    be rounded by its own gravity and it is so large that it
                    received a promotion to the status of a
                    <b>dwarf planet</b> in 2006, the same controversial
                    distinction given to <b>Pluto</b>.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Comets:</b> are dirty space snowballs of mostly ice and
                    dust that formed during the birth of the solar system 4.6
                    billion years ago. Most comets have stable orbits in the
                    outer reaches of the solar system past the planet Neptune.
                    They originate from either the <b>Kuiper belt</b> or the
                    <b>Oort Cloud</b>.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Meteoroids, Meteors, Meteorites</b>: Meteoroids are tiny
                    asteroids or the broken-off crumbs of comets and sometimes
                    planets. They range in size from a grain of sand to boulders
                    3 feet (1 meter) wide. When meteoroids collide with a
                    planet's atmosphere, they are called meteors (also known as
                    <b>Shooting stars</b>). If those meteors survive the
                    atmosphere and hit the planet's surface, their remains are
                    called meteorites.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <li>
                  Our solar system extends much farther than the eight planets
                  that orbit the Sun. It also includes the
                  <b>Kuiper Belt</b> that lies past Neptune's orbit. This is a
                  sparsely occupied ring of icy bodies, almost all smaller than
                  the most popular Kuiper Belt Object, dwarf planet Pluto.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Beyond the fringes of the Kuiper belt is the
                  <b>Oort Cloud</b>. Unlike the orbits of the planets and the
                  Kuiper Belt, which lie mostly in the same flat disk around the
                  Sun, the Oort Cloud is believed to be a giant spherical shell
                  surrounding the rest of the solar system. The Oort Cloud is
                  the boundary of the Sun's gravitational inﬂuence, where
                  orbiting objects can turn around and return closer to our Sun.

              <h2>Formation and Structure</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <h3>Formation</h3>
              <p>
                Our solar system formed about <b>4.6 billion years</b> ago from
                a dense cloud of interstellar gas and dust that collapsed,
                possibly due to the shockwave of a nearby exploding star
                (supernova). When this dust cloud collapsed, it formed a
                <b>solar nebula</b> — a spinning, swirling disk of material.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the center, gravity pulled more and more material in,
                Eventually the pressure in the core was so great that hydrogen
                atoms began to combine and form helium, releasing a tremendous
                amount of energy with that our Sun was born, and it eventually
                amassed more than 99.8 percent of the available matter in our
                solar system.
              </p>
              <p>
                Matter farther out in disk was also clumping together. These
                clumps smashed into one another, forming larger and larger
                objects. Some of them grew big enough for their gravity to shape
                them into spheres, becoming planets, dwart planets and large
                moons. In other cases, planets did not form, for example, the
                asteroid belt is made of bits and pieces of the early solar
                system that could never quite come together into a planet. Other
                smaller leftover pieces became asteroids, comets, meteoroids,
                and small, irregular moons.
              </p>
              <h3>Structure</h3>
              <p>
                The order and arrangement of the planets and other bodies in our
                solar system is due to the way the solar system formed. Nearest
                the Sun, only rocky material could withstand the heat when the
                solar system was young. For this reason, the first four
                planets—Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars—are
                <b>terrestrial planets</b>. They're small with solid, rocky
                surfaces.
              </p>
              <p>
                Meanwhile ice, liquid or gas settled in the outer regions of the
                young solar system. Gravity pulled these materials together, and
                that is where we find <b>Jovian Planets</b> which comprises of
                <b>gas giants</b> Jupiter and Saturn and
                <b>ice giants</b> Uranus and Neptune.

                <p>
                  There are more than 200 known moons in our solar system and
                  several more awaiting confirmations of discovery. Of the eight
                  planets, Mercury and Venus are the only ones with no moons.
                  The giant planets grab the most moons. Pluto, smaller than our
                  own moon, has ﬁve moons in its orbit, including the
                  <b>Charon</b>, a moon so large it makes Pluto wobble. Even
                  tiny asteroids can have moons. In 2017, scientists found
                  asteroid 3122 Florence had two tiny moons.

              <h2>The Sun</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                The Sun is the largest object within our solar system,
                comprising 99.8% of the system’s mass. It terms of atom count,
                the sun is about 91% hydrogen (the sun‘s fuel), 8.9 percent
                helium and 0.1 percent heavier elements such as carhon and
                nitrogen. Due to the sun's extreme temperatures these elements
                stay in a gas like phase called plasma.
              </p>
              <p>
                It takes 225 million years to complete one circle (revolution)
                around the center of the Milky Way. This is known as a
                <b>Cosmic year</b>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Its ﬁery nature along with a tremendous gravitational pull and
                an extensive magnetic ﬁeld helped it to become the heart of our
                solar system.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Layers:</b> The sun can be divided into six layers: the
                corona, the chromosphere, the Photosphere, the Convective Zone,
                the Radiative Zone and the Core.

                It has a surface temperature of about 6000<sup>o</sup>C. In the
                core temperatures reaching at least 15 million <sup>o</sup>C,
                combined with the sun's powerful gravity fuse together hydrogen
                molecules to create helium. This thermonuclear fusion, releases
                an enormous amount of energy in the form of radiation,
                electricity, solarwind and as we experience on earth,
                life-giving heat and light.
              </p>
              <h3>Gravitation Pull</h3>
              <p>
                Due to its immense size, the Sun has a great pull on the fabric
                of space, creating a gravitational force that causes nearby
                planetary bodies to be drawn toward it. Without sun, all the
                celestial bodies in our solar system would drift off into space.
                The Oort Cloud is regarded as the end of Sun's gravitational
                pull.
              </p>
              <h3>Magnetic Field or the heliosphere</h3>
              <p>
                Another critical property of the Sun is its magnetic ﬁeld which
                encapsulates the entire solarsystem. Called the
                <b> heliosphere</b> or <b>solar wind</b>, this force field
                protects the planets from harmful cosmic radiation. It's caused
                by the sun's plasma pushing electrically charged particles
                toward the sun's poles. This process turns the Sun into a giant
                magnet.
              </p>
              <p>
                Although the sun's magnetic field is invisible to the naked eye,
                its effects are noticeable. On the sun's surface are dark areas
                called sunspots, which marked strong pockets of magnetism. On
                Earth and on some of the other planets the sun's magnetic field
                interacts with their atmospheres resulting in beautiful Auroras.
              </p>
              <p>
                The solar winds extends far beyond even the region of Pluto,
                until it encounters the <b>termination shock</b>, where its
                motion slows abruptly due to the outside pressure of the
                interstellar medium. Beyond the shock lies the
                <b>heliosheath</b>, a broad transitional region between the
                inner heliosphere and the external environment. The outermost
                edge of the heliosphere is called the <b>heliopause</b>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Two NASA spacecraft, launched in 1977, have crossed the
                termination shock and the heliopause:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Voyager 1</b> crossed termination shock in 2004 and
                  heliopause in 2012 and
                </li>
                <li>

              </ul>
              <p>
                But it will be many thousands of years before the two Voyagers
                exit the Oort Cloud.

                Despite its size, the Sun will not last forever. In about 6.5
                billion years it will run out of its hydrogen fuel, expand to
                envelop Mercury, Venus and even earth and then collapse into a
                small star known as a <b>white dwarf</b> . In The meantime, the
                Sun will continue to play a critical role in the system that
                bears its name.

                Neptune (Useful Mnemonic: My Very Efficient Mother Just Served

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Named after roman god of speed Mercurius (messenger of the
                  gods), Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system and
                  nearest to the Sun, but it’s not the hottest planet (Venus is
                  hotter). Mercury is only slightly larger than Earth's Moon.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Like Earth, Mercury is a terrestrial planet with three main
                  layers, a core, a mantle, and a crust. But Mercury's crust has
                  no tectonic plates. Also, its iron core is enormous by
                  comparison, making up 85% of its radius, while Earth's inner
                  and outer core account for just 55%.
                </li>

                <li>Due to its proximity to the sun:</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    mercury is the fastest planet, going around the Sun every 88
                    Earth days.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    mercury has no atmosphere apart from a very thin exosphere,
                    which is traditionally the outermost layer of a planet's
                    atmosphere.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    the lack of atmosphere and close proximity to the sun also
                    makes Mercury a planet of extreme temperatures. The surface
                    temperature can can reach highs of 430°C (800°F) during the
                    daytime, and fall to -180°C (-290°F) at night.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    mercury is difficult to observe because it's fleeting and so
                    close to the sun.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <li>
                  It has no satellites and has a cratered surface, much like the
                  moon. It takes 58.65 Earth days, to revolved around itself.
                </li>

                  So far, it's only been visited by two spacecraft, NASA's
                  <b>Mariner 10</b> and <b>Messenger</b>. Those missions gave us
                  much of what we know today,

                  Named after the ancient Roman goddess of love and beauty,
                  Venus is the second planet from the Sun and our closest
                  planetary neighbor.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It is known as <b>Earth's Twin</b> since its about the same
                  size as Earth, (slightly smaller). It's structure is also
                  nearly identical, with an iron core, a hot mantle, and a rocky
                  crust. The crust of Venus, however, is dotted with thousands
                  of volcanoes. Also, it has no satellites.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Venus is unusual because it spins the opposite direction of
                  Earth and most other planets. It is the slowest rotating
                  planet which takes about 243 Earth days to spin around just
                  once. Because it's so close to the sun, a year goes by fast.
                  It takes 225 Earth days for Venus to go all the way around the
                  sun.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Its layered atmosphere is so thick, that it creates a surface
                  pressure so high that it would feel like you were 1 mile (1.6
                  kilometers) deep underwater.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The atmosphere is made of greenhouse gases, primarily carbon
                  dioxide. Which create an extreme case of global warming. They
                  trap the sun's heat, causing surface temperatures to rise over
                  470 degrees Celsius (880 degrees Fahrenheit), making it the
                  hottest planet in our solar system.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It reflects 70% of all the sunlight (albedo) that reaches the
                  planet, which is why Venus shines more brightly than any other
                  planet or star in the night sky.

                  While all of the planets, except for Earth, were named after

                  Germanic word, which simply means “the ground.”
                </li>
                <li>
                  It is the third planet from the Sun, orbiting the star from an

                  (149,597,870 km to be exact). It's close enough to the sun to
                  be warm.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It has a radius of 6,371 kilometers, Earth is the biggest of

                  It is the densest planet of all in the Solar System.

                <li>
                  Earth's unique position in the solar system allows it to house
                  phenomena yet to be found anywhere else in the universe,
                  particularly liquid surface water and life. Because of Earth's
                  unique distance from the sun, the planet is able to contain
                  water in all of its forms, liquid, ice and gas.

                  It has one natural satellite i.e., earth's moon. Since 71% of

                  Named after the ancient Romans god of war (because its reddish
                  color was reminiscent of blood), Mars is the second smallest
                  planet in the solar system and fourth from the sun.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Mars is dense and has a core made of iron, nickel and sulphur.
                  Enveloping the core is a rocky mantle made of silicate
                  minerals and a crust rich in iron. These iron minerals react
                  with the small traces of oxygen in Mars's atmosphere and
                  rusts, giving the planet its signature reddish hue. It is thus
                  called <b>'Red Planet'</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It completes one rotation every 24.6 hours. Martian days are
                  called sols—short for "solar day." A year on Mars lasts 669.6
                  sols, which is the same as 687 Earth days.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It has the largest volcano in the solar system called
                  <b>Olympus Mons</b>, that is three times the height of Mount
                  Everest. Once geologically active but not anymore.

                <li>
                  It is most intensely studied planet beyond earth. Water exists
                  today on Mars, but mostly in the form of polar ice caps.
                  Because of factors, such as the presence of water, some
                  scientists believe life may have existed on the Red Planet and
                  may exist in the future.

                <li>
                  Jupiter is the fifth planet from the sun and the first planet
                  to be formed in our solar system. It has twice the amount of
                  mass as the other planets put together. Its incredible
                  gravitational force serves as a shield by attracting comets
                  and asteroids onto Jupiter's own surface, preventing them from
                  crashing onto inner planets like Earth.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Despite its size, Jupiter has the shortest day of any other
                  planet; it only takes about 10 hours for a complete rotation.
                  But takes 11.8 years to revolve around the sun.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Unlike previoulsy seen terrestrial planets, Jupiter has no
                  solid surface. It may not even have a traditionally solid
                  core. Rather, this giant planet may have a dense, liquid
                  center surround by 44 miles thick atmosphere of hydrogen and
                  helium gases. Deep in the atmosphere, pressure and temperature
                  increase, compressing the hydrogen gas into a liquid. This
                  gives Jupiter the largest ocean in the solar system—an ocean
                  made of hydrogen instead of water.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The most iconic feature of Jupiter, is a crimson brown storm
                  that's been raging for over 300 years,
                  <b>the Great Red Spot</b>. Even the largest and most powerful
                  hurricanes ever recorded on Earth would be dwarfed by the

                  Jupiter also has several rings, but unlike the famous rings of

                  Named after the Roman god of agriculture and wealth (who is
                  also the father of Jupiter), Saturn is the sixth planet from
                  the Sun and the second largest planet in our solar system.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Despite its size, Saturn is actually the lightest planet. It
                  could float in a bathtub if such a colossal thing existed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Like fellow gas giant Jupiter, Saturn is a massive ball made
                  mostly of hydrogen and helium. Saturn's gaseous makeup also
                  means that it has no true surface. At its center, the planet
                  has a dense core of water, ice, and rocky material, but it has
                  no actual landmass.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It takes about 10 hours to rotate around its axis and 29.4
                  years to revolve around the sun.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Saturn's ring system is the largest and most complex in the
                  entire solar system. The rings are made of icy and rocky
                  remnants from comets, asteroids, and moons. How the rings are
                  able to stay on track and intact has to do with Saturn's
                  smallest moons. Called Shepherding moons, these tiny
                  satellites orbit between the rings, and they seem to use their
                  gravity to shape the ring material into circular paths.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Saturn has more than 60 known moons, and each varies in size
                  and terrain.

                  <h4>Uranus</h4>
                </div>
              </div>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Named after Greek god of the sky, Uranus is the seventh planet
                  from the Sun with the third largest diameter in our solar
                  system.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Uranus takes 17 hours to rotate and 84 Earth years to orbit
                  the sun. Partially due to its distance from the Sun (20 AU),
                  Uranus boasts the coldest temperatures in the solar system
                  with temperatures, dropping as low as -224.2 degrees Celsius
                  (-370 degrees Fahrenheit).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Uranus has an Earth-sized core made of iron and magnesium
                  silicate. The remainder, approximately 80% of Uranus, is a
                  worldwide ocean of ices made of water, ammonia, and methane.
                  This chemical composition makes planet appear in cool blue
                  color.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In addition to its extreme temperatures and orbit, Uranus has
                  a dramatic orientation. While the other seven planets spin on
                  their axes like tops, Uranus appears to roll along its
                  equator. The planet is tilted at a near right angle, in which
                  polar regions point toward and away from the Sun, rather than
                  upward and downward.
                </li>
                <li>
                  This tilt, thought to be the result of Uranus' collision with
                  at least one celestial body, has also affected the orientation
                  of Uranus' 13 rings and 27 known moons. Unlike the rings and
                  moons of other worlds, which orbit their home planets
                  horizontally, those of Uranus orbit in a vertical orientation
                  along the planet's tilted equator.

                  Named after the Roman god of the sea, Neptune is the eigth and
                  most distant planet in our solar system. Being so far away
                  from the heat and light of the Sun, Neptune is cold, dark, and
                  icy.
                </li>
                <li>
                  With a distance of 30 Astronomical Units from the sun, Neptune
                  is the only planet in our solar system not visible to the
                  naked eye. This distance creates the longest orbit of the
                  eight worlds, about 165 years. Its rotational time is 16
                  hours.
                </li>
                <li>
                  At its heart is a solid core about 1.5 times the size of
                  Earth. Making up about 45% of the planet's mass, the core is
                  made of water, ice and silicate rock. The rest of the planet
                  is believed to be a hot pressurized ocean of water, methane,
                  and ammonia ices surrounded by a layer of cloud made of
                  hydrogen and helium, include traces of methane, which give
                  this ocean world its rich blue color.

                <li>
                  Neptune is our solar system's windiest world. These winds whip
                  clouds of frozen methane across the planet at speeds of more
                  than 2,000 kilometers per hour (1,200 mph) . Even Earth's most
                  powerful winds hit only about 400 kilometers per hour (250
                  mph). In fact, the winds are so powerful that they break the
                  sound barrier.

                  Earth's only natural satellite is simply called "the Moon"
                  because people didn't know other moons existed until Galileo
                  Galilei discovered four moons orbiting Jupiter in 1610.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Moon is the brightest and largest object in our night sky that
                  makes Earth a more livable planet by moderating earths wobble
                  on its axis, leading to a relatively stable climate. It also
                  causes tides, creating a rhythm that has guided humans for
                  thousands of years.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Moon was likely formed after a Mars-sized body collided
                  with Earth several billion years ago. Debris from this
                  collision began to orbit Earth, and accumulated, forming
                  today's moon.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It is fifth largest moon in the solar system with size nearly
                  1/4th the size of earth. It is composed of an iron rich core,
                  plus a mantle and crust containing minerals made of magnesium,
                  oxygen and silicon. The moon's surface was once geologically
                  active and covered in an ocean of magma. But today, apart from
                  traces of water ice, the surface is completely covered in dust
                  and rocky debris.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Countless craters dot the moon's surface. Each formed by
                  objects such as meteroids, comets and asteroids crashing onto
                  the moon. The largest crater, the South Pole Aitkin basin,
                  spans across a quarter of the moon's surface, and is nearly
                  deep enough to fit Mount Everest inside.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The moon is about 3,84,400 km away from earth. It takes 27
                  days 7 hours (27.32 days) to rotate around its axis. It
                  rotates at the same rate that it revolves (called synchronous
                  rotation). So as it revolves around our planet, the same side
                  of the moon faces the Earth at all times .
                </li>
                <li>
                  In Latin, the Moon is called Luna, which is the main adjective
                  for all things Moon-related: lunar.

                <li>
                  Similar to earth's orbit around the sun, moon's orbit around
                  the earth is elliptical. The point of the orbit at which the
                  moon is closest to Earth is called <b>perigee</b> (360,000
                  km), while the point at which the moon is farthest from Earth
                  is known as <b>apogee</b> (405,000 km).

                  From the Earth's surface, we can observe eight distinct
                  traditionally recognized stages of the moon's illumination,
                  called lunar phases. They have been observed for thousands of
                  years, and even provided the basis for the earliest calendars.
