              <h1 class="title">Rocks and Minerals</h1>
              <h2>Minerals</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                A Mineral is a naturally occurring organic or an inorganic
                substance, having an orderly atomic structure and a definite
                chemical composition and physical properties. A mineral is
                composed of two or more elements. But, sometimes single element
                minerals like sulphur, copper, silver, gold, graphite etc. are
                found.
              </p>
              <p>
                The basic source of all minerals is the hot magma in the
                interior of the earth. When magma cools, crystals of minerals
                appear and a systematic series of minerals are formed in
                sequence to solidify so as to form rocks.
              </p>

              <h2>Types of Mineral Resources</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                On the basis of chemical and physical properties, minerals may
                be grouped under two main categories of metallics and
                non-metallics which may further be classified as follows:
              </p>
              <div class="img bigimg">
                <img
                  src="../images/geography/types-of-minerals.png"
                  alt="Types of Minerals"
                  style="width: 100%"
                />
              </div>
              <p>
                Metallic minerals are the sources of metals. Iron ore, copper,
                gold produce metal and are included in this category. Metallic
                minerals are further divided into ferrous and non-ferrous
                metallic minerals. Ferrous refers to iron. All those minerals
                which have iron content are ferrous such as iron ore itself and
                those which do not have iron content are non-ferrous such as
                copper, bauxite, etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                Non-metallic minerals are either organic in origin such as
                fossil fuels also known as mineral fuels which are derived from
                the buried animal and plant life such as coal and petroleum.
                Other type of non-metallic minerals are inorganic in origin such
                as mica, limestone and graphite, etc.
              </p>
              <p>Minerals have certain characteristics:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>These are unevenly distributed over space.</li>
                <li>
                  There is inverse relationship in quality and quantity of
                  minerals i.e. good quality minerals are less in quantity as
                  compared to low quality minerals.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The third main characteristic is that all minerals are
                  exhaustible over time. These take long to develop geologically
                  and they cannot be replenished immediately at the time of
                  need. Thus, they have to be conserved and not misused.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Some of the major minerals include Feldspar, Quartz, Pyroxene,
                Amphibole, Mica and Olivine.
              </p>
              <h2>Rocks</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                A rock is an aggregate of one or more minerals. Rocks do not
                have definite composition of mineral constituents. Feldspar and
                quartz are the most common minerals found in rocks.
              </p>
              <p>
                Rocks are mainly of three types: igneous, sedimentary and
                metamorphic rocks. Each rock type is altered when it is forced
                out of its equilibrium conditions by physical changes—such as
                melting, cooling, eroding, compacting, or deforming.
              </p>
              <h3>Igneous Rocks</h3>
              <p>
                The igneous rocks are formed when magma cools and solidifies.
                They are known as the <b>Primary Rocks</b> as all other rocks
                are formed directly or indirectly from the igneous rocks.
              </p>
              <p>
                On the basis of mode of occurence, igneous rocks are classified
                as:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Intrusive Igneous Rocks</b>: are formed due to the
                  solidification of rising magma below the surface of the earth.
                  They have huge mineral grains (or crystals) as the cooling
                  takes place slowly. Ex: Granite.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Extrusive Igneous Rocks</b>: are formed due to cooling and
                  solidification of hot and molten magma at the surface of the
                  earth. They have small mineral grains (or crystals) and are
                  relatively smooth as the cooling takes place rapidly. Ex:
                  Basalt.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Sedimentary Rock</h3>
              <p>
                Sedimentary rocks are formed due to the deposition, aggregation
                and subsequent compaction of sediments derived from the older
                rocks or dead remains of plants and animals.
              </p>
              <p>On the basis of formation, they are of three types:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Clastic sedimentary rocks:</b> These rocks are formed by
                  mechanical compression of smaller grains of rocks broken off
                  other rocks by physical weathering. Ex: Sandstone, limestone,
                  shale etc.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Chemical sedimentary rocks:</b> These rocks are formed from
                  dissolved chemicals that hardens over time. Ex: Chert,
                  limestone etc.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Organic sedimentary rocks:</b> These rocks are formed from
                  the accumulation of plant and animal debris. These rocks often
                  contain fossils. Ex: Coal.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Metamorphic Rocks</h3>
              <p>
                Metamorphic rocks are formed by subjecting any rock
                type—sedimentary rock, igneous rock or another older metamorphic
                rock— to different <b>temperature</b> and
                <b>pressure</b> conditions than those in which the original rock
                was formed.
              </p>
              <p>
                Metomorphism of rocks takes place with changes in pressure,
                volume and temperature (PVT).
              </p>
              <p>
                This process is called metamorphism, meaning to "change in
                form". By Metamorphism, already formed rocks undergo
                recrystallisation and reorganisation of materials within
                original rocks. The result is a profound change in physical
                properties and chemistry of the stone.
              </p>
              <p>They are of two types:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Foliated metamorphic rocks</b> have a layered appearance
                  that is produced by exposure to heat and directed pressure.
                  Examples: gneiss, schist, and slate.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Non-foliated metamorphic rocks</b> do not have a layered
                  appearance. Examples of nonfoliated rocks include: marble,
                  quartzite etc.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <div class="note">
                <h3 style="text-align: center">Rock Cycle</h3>
                <p>
                  One type of rock changes to another type under certain
                  conditions in a cyclic manner. This process of transformation
                  of the rock from one to another is known as the
                  <b>rock cycle</b> .
                </p>

                <p><b>Rock Cycle Process</b>:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Molten magma cools and solidifies to become igneous rocks.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    These igneous rocks are broken down into small particles
                    that are transported, deposited and compacted to form
                    sedimentary rocks.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    When the igneous and sedimentary rocks are subjected to heat
                    and pressure they change into metamorphic rocks.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The metamorphic rocks which are still under great heat and
                    pressure melt down to form molten magma. This molten magma
                    again can cool down and solidify into igneous rocks and the
                    process repeats.
                  </li>
