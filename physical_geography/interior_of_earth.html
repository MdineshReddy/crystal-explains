              <h1 class="title">Interior of the Earth</h1>
              <p>
                Earth radius ranges from 6,378 km at the equator to 6,357 km at
                a pole. The interior of the Earth is divided into three parts
                namely, crust, mantle and core.
              </p>
              <h2>Sources of Information about the Earth</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <h3>Direct Sources</h3>
              <p>
                The most easily available solid earth material is surface rock
                or the rocks obtained from <b>mining</b> areas. Gold mines in
                South Africa are as deep as 3 - 4 km. Mining beyond this depth
                is not possible as it is very hot at this depth.
              </p>

              <p>
                Besides mining, scientists have taken up a number of projects to
                penetrate deeper depths to explore the conditions in the crustal
                portions. Scientists world over are working on many major
                projects. <b>Kola Superdeep Borehole</b> of the erstwhile Soviet
                Union near the present-day Russia and Norway border is the
                deepest drill on earth with depth of 12.2 km and often regarded
                as entrance to hell. This and many deep drilling projects have
                provided large volume of information through the analysis of
                materials collected at different depths.
              </p>

              <p>
                <b>Volcanic eruption</b> forms another source of obtaining
                direct information. As and when the molten material (magma) is
                thrown onto the surface of the earth, during volcanic eruption,
                it becomes available for laboratory analysis. However, it is
                difficult to ascertain the depth of the source of such magma.
              </p>
              <h3>Indirect Sources</h3>
              <p>
                Analysis of properties of matter indirectly provides information
                about the interior. We know through the mining activity that
                temperature and pressure increase as we go deep. Moreover, it is
                also known that the density of the material also increases with
                depth. It is possible to find the rate of change of these
                characteristics. Knowing the total thickness of the earth,
                scientists have estimated the values of temperature, pressure
                and the density of materials at different depths.
              </p>

              <p>
                Another source of information are the <b>meteors</b> that at
                times reach the earth. The material and the structure observed
                in the meteors are similar to that of the earth. They are solid
                bodies developed out of materials same as, or similar to, our
                planet. Hence, this becomes yet another source of information
                about the interior of the earth.
              </p>
              <p>
                The other indirect sources include gravitation, magnetic field,
                and seismic activity.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Gravitation</b>
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The gravitation force (g) is not the same at different
                  latitudes on the surface. It is greater near the poles and
                  less at the equator. This is because of the shape of earth.
                  Its not a perfect sphere. There is a small flattening at the
                  poles and bulging around the equator due to Earth's rotation,
                  thereby distance from the centre at the equator being greater
                  than that at the poles. [Gravity decreases as distance
                  Increases].
                </li>
                <li>
                  The gravity values also differ according to the mass of
                  material. The uneven distribution of mass of material within
                  the earth influences this value. The reading of the gravity at
                  different places is influenced by many other factors. These
                  readings differ from the expected values. Such a difference is
                  called gravity anomaly. Gravity anomalies give us information
                  about the distribution of mass of the material in the crust of
                  the earth.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                <b>Magnetic Surveys</b>: also provide information about the
                distribution of magnetic materials in the crustal portion, and
                thus, provide information about the distribution of materials in
                this part.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b> Seismic activity </b> is one of the most important sources
                of information about the interior of the earth.

              <h3>Crust</h3>
              <p>
                The Crust is the Outermost and the thinnest layer of the Earth.
                Its thickness ranges from 5–70 kilometres.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The thin parts are the <b>oceanic crust</b>, which underlie
                  the ocean basins. Their thickness ranges from 5-10 km. The
                  main mineral constituents of the Oceanic Crust are
                  <b>silica</b> and <b>magnesium</b> and therefore called
                  <b>sima</b>. They are composed of much denser rocks (like
                  basalt) compared to those of Continental Crustal rocks (like
                  Granite).
                </li>
                <li>
                  The thicker crust is <b>continental crust</b> with mean
                  thickness of 30 km. It is much thicker in the areas of major
                  mountain systems for example, it is as much as 70 km thick in
                  the Himalayan region. The main mineral constituents of the
                  Continental Crust are <b>silica</b> and <b>alumina</b> and
                  therefore called <b>sial</b>. They are composed of less denser
                  rocks (like Granite) compared to those of Oceaninc Crustal
                  rocks (like basalt).
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                About 98 per cent of the total crust of the earth is composed of
                eight elements like oxygen (46%), silicon (28%), aluminium (8%),
                iron (5%), calcium (4%), sodium (3%), potassium (2%) and
                magnesium(2%). The average density of the crust is about 2.7
                g/cm³.
              </p>
              <p>
                (average density of the earth is 5.51 g/cm³). The boundary
                between the Crust and Mantle is called
                <b>Mohorovicic Discontinuity</b>, or the Moho. It is defined by
                the distinct change in velocity of seismological waves as they
                pass through changing densities of rock.
              </p>
              <h3>Mantle</h3>
              <p>
                The portion of the interior beyond the crust is called the
                mantle. The mantle extends from Moho’s discontinuity to a depth
                of 2,900 km. It is composed of <b>silicate rocks</b> richer in
                iron and magnesium than the overlying crust. The average density
                is about 4.5 g/cm³.
              </p>
              <p>
                During the early stages of earth's formation, the mantle was
                molten. Over millions of years, the mantle cooled. Water trapped
                inside minerals erupted with lava, a process called
                “outgassing.” As more water was outgassed, the mantle
                solidified.
              </p>
              <p>
                Convection (transfer of heat in fluids by the actual motion of
                matter) of the mantle propels the motion of the tectonic plates
                in the crust. The source of heat that drives this motion is the
                primordial heat left over from the planet's formation, renewed
                by the radioactive decay of uranium, thorium, and potassium in
                Earth's crust and mantle.
              </p>
              <p>
                The mantle is divided into upper and lower mantle separated by a
                transition zone, as a result of sudden seismic-velocity
                discontinuities at depths of 410 and 660 km.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Upper Mantle</b>: begins just beneath the crust and ends at
                the top of the lower mantle at 660 km.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The uppermost solid part of the mantle along with the crust is
                  called
                  <b>Lithosphere</b>. It extends upto a depth of 200km.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Below the Lithosphere is the <b>asthenosphere</b>, a highly
                  viscous, mechanically weak and ductile part of upper mantle.
                  Astheno means "Weak". It is considered to be extending upto
                  400 km. It is the main source of magma that finds its way to
                  the surface during volcanic eruptions. The weakness of the
                  asthenosphere allows the tectonic plates to move easily
                  towards a subduction zone.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                <b>Transition Zone</b>: is located between the lower mantle and
                the upper mantle, between a depth of 410 and 660 km. It is also
                referred to as <b>Repetti discontinuity</b>.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Lower Mantle</b>: extends from 660 to 2900 km below Earth's
                surface; between the transition zone and the outer core.
              </p>
              <p>
                The lowest part of the mantle next to the core-mantle boundary
                is known as the <b>D″ (D-double-prime) layer</b>. Core-Mantle
                boundary, also referred to as <b>Gutenberg discontinuity</b> is
                at the depth of 2900 km..
              </p>
              <h3>Core</h3>
              <p>
                The core is the innermost layer of the Earth and occupies its
                centre. It is about 3500 km in radius. Information about Earth's
                core mostly comes from analysis of seismic waves and Earth's
                magnetic field.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Core is believed to be mostly composed of an iron–nickel
                alloy; therefore it is referred to as <b>nife</b>. The average
                density is about 11.0 g/cm³.
              </p>

              <p>
                The core is further divided into outer core and inner core. The
                outer core is in liquid state while the inner core is in solid
                state.
              </p>
              <p><b>Outer Core</b>:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  It extends from 2900 km and 5100 km below the earth’s surface
                  and surrounds the inner core. Density ranges from 9.9 g/cm³ to
                  12.2 g/cm³.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The temperature of the outer core ranges from 4400 °C in the
                  outer regions to 6000 °C near the inner core.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It is composed of iron mixed with nickel (nife) and trace
                  amounts of lighter elements.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The outer core is not under enough pressure to be solid, so it
                  is liquid even though it has a composition similar to the
                  inner core.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Dynamo theory suggests that convection in the outer core,
                  combined with the Coriolis effect, gives rise to Earth's
                  magnetic field.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <div class="note">
                <p>
                  <b> Coriolis effect:</b>
                  is an effect in which a rotating object experiences a force
                  (the Coriolis force) perpendicular to the object's axis of
                  rotation. On the earth, the effect tends to deflect moving
                  objects to the right in the northern hemisphere and to the
                  left in the southern and is important in the formation of
                  cyclonic weather systems.

              <p>
                <b>Inner Core</b>
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The inner core extends from 5100 km below the earth’s surface
                  to the centre of the earth. Density ranges from 12.6 g/cm³ to
                  13 g/cm³.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The solid inner core is too hot to hold a permanent magnetic
                  field but probably acts to stabilize the magnetic field
                  generated by the liquid outer core.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It has a temperature reaching 6000°C. At 6000°C, this iron
                  core is as hot as the Sun’s surface, but the crushing pressure
                  caused by gravity prevents it from becoming liquid.
                </li>
              </ul>

                <b>Note:</b> Although the core and mantle are about equal in
                thickness, the core actually forms only 15 percent of the
                Earth's volume, whereas the mantle occupies 84 percent. The
                crust makes up the remaining 1 percent.
