                The Observable Universe comprises of about 2 trillion galaxies.
                The galaxies are made up of billions of stars held together by
                the force of gravity and these stars account for most of the
                masses of the galaxy.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our own galaxy is called the <b>Milky Way</b> (Akash Ganga) and
                it contains more than 400 billion stars. One of these stars
                happens to be our Sun. Planets and other objects revolve around
                the sun and makeup the solar system with the sun at the center.
                <b>Andromeda</b> is our nearest galaxy. Structurally, galaxies
                are found in four forms:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Spiral Galaxies</b> have a flat, spinning disk with a
                  central bulge called <b>nucleus</b> surrounded by spiral arms.
                  Milky Way and Andromeda are the examples.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Spiral Barred Galaxies:</b> are the ones that have their
                  arms spiral out from a straight bar of stars instead of coming
                  from a nucleus.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Elliptical Galaxies</b> have an elongated oval shape and
                  lack any nucleus or straight bar at the center.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Irregular galaxies</b> are the galaxies with no definite
                  shape.

                  History of the center of the Universe
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Starting from ancient greece and egypt to the middle ages, the
                  Earth was believed to be the center of the Universe and the
                  Sun and other heavenly bodies revolved around it. This theory
                  is called
                  <b>Geocentric Theory</b>. Prominent proponents of this theory
                  were two influential Greek philosophers of 4th century BC,
                  Plato and his student Aristotle and later in 2nd century AD,
                  Ptolemy in Egypt.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 16th century AD, <b> Nicolaus Copernicus</b> propounded the
                  theory that the Sun not the Earth is the center of the
                  Universe. This theory is called <b>Geocentric Theory</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the early-20th century, the discovery of other galaxies and
                  the development of the Big Bang theory led to theorise that
                  the Universe lacks a central point and is expanding at all
                  points.
                </p>
              </div>
              <h2>Origin of the Universe</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                The origin of the universe is the origin of everything. Multiple
                scientific theories and creation myths from around the world
                have tried to explain its mysterious genesis. However, the most
                widely accepted explanation is the Big Bang theory based on an
                idea proposed by an astronomer named <b>Georges Lemaitre</b>.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 1927, Lemaitre believed that a very long time ago, the
                universe started as just a single point (often called
                <b>singularity</b>) and it stretched and expanded to get as big
                as it is now, and that it could keep on stretching.
              </p>
              <p>
                Just two years later, an astronomer named
                <b>Edwin Hubble</b> noticed that other galaxies were moving away
                from us and the farthest galaxies were moving faster than the
                ones close to us. This meant that the universe was still
                expanding, just like Lemaitre thought. If things were moving
                apart, it meant that long ago, everything had been close
                together.
              </p>
              <h3>The Big Bang Theory</h3>
              <p>
                The Big Bang theory states that the universe began as a hot and
                infinitely dense point (only a few millimeters wide). About
                <b>13.7 billion years</b> ago this tiny singularity violently
                exploded. And it is from this explosion (or bang), that all
                matter, energy, space, and time were created.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are two major stages in the evolution of the Universe
                called the radiation and matter eras. Each era is made of
                smaller stages call epochs.
              </p>
              <p><b>Radiation Era (first 20 minutes after big bang)</b></p>
              <p>
                This era started right after the Big Bang and is dominated by
                presence of radiation from the explosion. It includes the
                following epochs:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Planck Epoch (started right after the Big Bang)</b> is the
                  earliest epoch where no matter existed in the universe. Only
                  energy and the ancestor to the four forces of nature called
                  the <b>superforce</b> existed.

                The universe's new ability to form elements, the building blocks
                of matter, queued the matter era. It includes the following
                epochs:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Atomic Epoch:</b> during which the universe's temperature
                  cooled down enough for electrons to attach to nuclei for the
                  first time. This process called <b>recombination</b>, helped
                  create the universe's second element, hydrogen.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Galactic Epoch:</b>
                  The hydrogen, along with helium atoms, dotted the universe
                  with atomic clouds called <b>nebula</b>. Within the clouds,
                  small pockets of gas may have had enough gravity to cause
                  atoms to collect. These clusters of atoms, formed during the
                  galactic epoch, became the seedlings of galaxies.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Stellar Epoch</b>: Nestled inside those galaxies, localised
                  clumps of gas continue to grow into even denser gaseous
                  bodies, giving rise to formation of stars. And in doing so,
                  they queued the latest and current stage of the universe's
                  development, the stellar epoch.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The formation of stars then caused a tremendous ripple effect
                and helped shape the universe as we know it. Heat within the
                stars caused the conversion of helium and hydrogen into almost
                all the remaining elements in the universe. In turn, those
                elements became the building blocks for planets, moons, life,
                everything we see today.

              <h3>Life Cycle of a Star</h3>
              <p>
                <b>Giant Gas Cloud</b>: A Star originates from a large cloud of
                dust and gas called <b>nebuli</b>. The temperature in the cloud
                is low enough for the synthesis of molecules.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Protostar</b>: Nebuli condenses into a huge globule of gas
                and dust and contracts under its own gravity. The region of
                condensing matter will begin to heat up and starts to glow
                forming <b>Protostars</b>.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>T-Tauri Phase:</b> A T-Tauri star begins when materials stop
                falling into the protostar. The mean temperature of the T-Tauri
                Star isn't enough to support nuclear fusion at its core.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Main Sequence Star</b>: The main sequence phase is the stage
                in development where the core temperature reaches the point for
                the fusion to commence. At this temperature, nuclear reactions
                in which hydrogen fuses to form helium can start (nuclear
                fusion). This reaction is <b>exothermic</b>, the star begins to
                release energy, stopping it from contracting even more and
                causes it to shine.
              </p>
              <p>
                What happens to a star during the rest of its life depends on
                how massive the star is at its birth:
              </p>
              <p><b>For less massive stars such as the Sun:</b></p>
              <p>
                A star like the sun is in a delicate balance between gravity
                which wants to make the star collapse in on itself and the
                pressure (that comes from the energy produced by the fusion
                reactions at its core) that pushes outwards.
              </p>
              <p>
                At some point in the future, the hydrogen runs out. At that
                point, the core of the star will start to collapse under its own
                weight. It gets denser and hotter until the point where they
                start to use the helium atoms themselves as the fuel for the
                fusion, pushing helium atoms together, making carbon and oxygen,
                the next heavier elements on the periodic table. As the star
                begins to fuse helium, it creates more energy and that causes
                the outer layers of the star to expand.

                One day, our sun will grow so large, it will swallow up the
                inner planets of the solar system out as far as the Earth. It
                will become a <b>red giant</b>. For the sun, this will be the
                beginning of the end. What happens is that the outer layers of
                the star get farther and farther from the middle, the force of
                gravity that they feel is getting weaker. Eventually, the star
                loses hold of its outer atmosphere, which then drifts off out
                into space and expands to become a <b>planetary nebula</b>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once the outer layers have drifted away, all that is left of the
                star is its core. A <b>white dwarf star</b> is the dead, remnant
                core of a star like the sun at the end of its life. It's
                something that might weight as much as 1/2 the mass ofthe sun
                but it's only about the size of the Earth, so it's an incredibly
                dense object. It's dead, there's no nuclear fusion going on any
                more, it‘s incredibly hot but then over millions of years, it
                will gradually cool down to become a <b>black dwarf</b>.

              <p><b>For stars that are much more massive than the Sun:</b></p>
              <p>
                Stars that are much more massive than the sun lead very
                different lives. They are able to fuse heavier and heavier
                elements inside their core. The star gets bigger and bigger some
                grow up to 1000 times the size of our sun until it has fused
                elements all the way up to iron (which is considered nuclear
                ash).
              </p>
              <p>
                Once an iron core is formed, there's no more energy that can be
                got from fusion. The core Collapses, the rest of the star starts
                to Collapse in after it. And then suddenly, here's a huge shock
                wave and in just a second: BANG! The outer parts of the star are
                blasted off in to space in a huge
                <b>super-nova</b> explosion!
              </p>
              <p>
                These super-nova explosions are so powerful that when one of
                these stars explodes it can actually outshine the whole galaxy
                of which it is a part. For these super giant stars all that is
                left is a super dense core known as a <b>neutron star</b>, an
                object that can have a mass greater than our sun but be less
                than 20 kilometers across.

              <p>
                For the most massive stars of all, when the core collapses the
                gravity is so strong, it becomes a <b>Black Hole</b> from which
                even light cannot escape.

                <p>
                  The Chandrasekhar limit is the maximum mass of a stable white
                  dwarf star. The currently accepted value of the Chandrasekhar
                  limit is about <b>1.4 times the mass of the sun</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If the mass of a star is below the Chandrasekhar limit, it
                  resist the complete collapse of the star and end up as a white
                  dwarf. If the mass is greater than the limit, then the star is
                  subject to further gravitational collapse, evolving into a
                  different type of stellar remnant, such as a neutron star or
                  black hole.
