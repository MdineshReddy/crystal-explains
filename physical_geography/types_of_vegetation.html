              <h1 class="title">Types of Vegatation</h1>
              <p>
                The type and thickness of natural vegetation varies from place
                to place because of the variation in factors such as climate,
                sunlight & temperature, moisture, soil and height. Natural
                vegetation is generally classified in to three broad categories
                as follows:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Forests</b>: grow where temperature and rainfall are
                  plentiful to support a tree cover.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Grasslands:</b> Which grow in the region of moderate rain.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Shrubs:</b> Thorny shrubs and scrubs grow in the dry
                  region.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <div class="img bigimg">

              </div>
              <h2>Types of Forests</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <h3>Tropical Evergreen Forests</h3>
              <p>
                These forests are also called <b>tropical rainforests</b>. These
                thick forests occur in the regions near the equator and close to
                the tropics. These regions are hot and receive heavy rainfall
                throughout the year. They are at their best in areas having
                <b>more than 200 cm of rainfall</b> with a short dry season.
                Since the region is warm and wet throughout the year, the trees
                do not shed their leaves altogether. This is the reason they are
                called <b>evergreen</b>.
              </p>
              <p>
                The thick canopies of the closely spaced trees do not allow the
                sunlight to penetrate inside the forest even in the day time.
                Hardwood trees like rosewood, ebony, mahogany, rubber and
                cinchona. are common here.
              </p>
              <p>
                The common animals found in these forests are elephant, monkey,
                lemur and deer. One-horned rhinoceroses are found in the jungles
                of Assam and West Bengal. Besides these animals, plenty of
                birds, bats, sloth, scorpions and snails are also found in these
                jungles.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ex: The Amazon rainforest in South America is the largest, most
                diverse tropical rainforest on Earth. It is referred to as the
                <b> 'Lungs of the Planet Earth'</b>. In India, they are
                restricted to heavy rainfall areas of the Western Ghats and the
                island groups of Lakshadweep, Andaman and Nicobar, upper parts
                of Assam.
              </p>
              <h3>Tropical Deciduous Forest</h3>
              <p>
                Tropical deciduous are the <b>monsoon forests</b> found in the
                <b>large part of India</b>, northern Australia and in central
                America. These regions experience seasonal changes with rainfall
                between <b>200 cm and 70 cm</b>. Trees shed their leaves in the
                dry season to conserve water.
              </p>

              <p>
                The hardwood trees found in these forests are sal, teak, neem
                and shisham. Hardwood trees are extremely useful for making
                furniture, transport and constructional materials. Though less
                biologically diverse than rainforests, tropical dry forests are
                home to a wide variety of wildlife including monkeys, tigers and
                other large cats, deer, parrots, various rodents, and ground
                dwelling birds.
              </p>
              <h3>Temperate Evergreen Forests</h3>
              <p>
                The temperate evergreen forests are located in the
                mid-latitudinal coastal region. They are commonly found along
                the eastern margin of the continents, e.g., In south east USA,
                South China and in South East Brazil. They comprise both hard
                and soft wood trees like oak, pine, eucalyptus, etc
              </p>
              <h3>Temperate Deciduous Forests</h3>
              <p>
                As we go towards higher latitudes, there are more temperate
                deciduous forests. These are found in the north eastern part of
                USA, China, New Zealand, Chile and also found in the coastal
                regions of Western Europe. They shed their leaves in the dry
                season. The common trees are oak, ash, beech, etc. Deer, foxes,
                wolves are the animals commonly found. Birds like pheasants,
                monals are also found here.
              </p>
              <h3>Mediterranean Vegetation</h3>
              <p>
                The west and south west margins of the continents are covered by
                Mediterranean vegetation. It is mostly found in the areas around
                the Mediterranean sea in Europe, Africa and Asia, hence the
                name. This kind of vegetation is also found outside the actual
                Mediterranean region in California in the USA, south west
                Africa, western South America and South west Australia.
              </p>

                These regions are marked for hot dry summers and mild rainy
                winters. Citrus fruits such as oranges, figs, olives and grapes
                are commonly cultivated here. Mediterranean regions are known as
                <b>‘Orchards of the world’</b> for their fruit cultivation.
                There isn’t much wildlife here.

              <h3>Coniferous Forests or Montane Forests</h3>
              <p>
                In the higher latitudes (50° – 70°) of Northern hemisphere the
                spectacular Coniferous forests are found. These are also called
                as <b>Taiga</b>. These forests are also seen in the higher
                altitudes.
              </p>

                Trees here are tall, softwood evergreen trees. However, they get
                progressively stunted as they approach the snow-line.
                Ultimately, through shrubs and scrubs, they merge into the
                Alpine grasslands. The woods of these trees are very useful for
                making pulp, which is used for manufacturing paper and
                newsprint. Match boxes and packing boxes are also made from
                softwood. Chir, pine, cedar are the important variety of trees
                in these forests.

              <h2>Grasslands</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <h3>Tropical grasslands</h3>
              <p>
                These occur on either side of the equator and extend till the
                tropics. This vegetation grows in the areas of moderate to low
                amount of rainfall. The grass can grow very tall, about 3 to 4
                metres in height. Savannah grasslands of Africa are of this
                type. Elephants, zebras, giraffes, deer, leopards are common in
                tropical grasslands.
              </p>
              <h3>Temperate grasslands</h3>
              <p>
                These are found in the mid-latitudinal zones and in the interior
                part of the continents. Usually, grass here is short and
                nutritious. Wild buffaloes, bisons, antilopes are common in the
                temperate region.

              <p>
                These are found in the dry desert like regions. Tropical deserts
                are located on the western margins of the continents. The
                vegetation cover is scarce here because of scanty rain and
                scorching heat.
              </p>
              <h3>Tundra Vegetation</h3>
              <p>
                This vegetation is found in places of extremely cold. The growth
                of natural vegetation is very limited here. Only mosses, lichens
                and very small shrubs are found here. It grows during the very
                short summer. This is called Tundra type of vegetation. This
                vegetation is found in the polar areas of Europe, Asia and North
                America. The animals have thick fur and thick skin to protect
                themselves from the cold climatic conditions. Seal, walruses,
                musk-oxen, Arctic owl, Polar bear and snow foxes are some of the
                animals found here.
              </p>
              <p>
                Alpine tundra is a type of natural region or biome that does not
                contain trees because it is at high elevation.
