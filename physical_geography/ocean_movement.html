              <h1 class="title">Ocean Water Movements</h1>
              <p>
                Ocean Water is constantly moving from one place to another. The
                horizontal motion of oceans include the ocean currents and
                waves. The vertical motion includes the tides.
              </p>
              <p>
                An Ocean's movement is affected by its physical characteristics
                like temperature, salinity, density and the external forces like
                of the sun, moon and the winds influence the movement of ocean
                water.
              </p>
              <h2>Waves</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Waves are oscillatory movements of the ocean water that result
                  in the rise and fall of surface water. Waves travel because
                  wind pushes the water body in its course while gravity pulls
                  the crests of the waves downward. The falling water pushes the
                  former troughs upward, and the wave moves to a new position.
                  The actual motion of the water beneath the waves is circular.
                  It indicates that things are carried up and forward as the
                  wave approaches, and down and back as it passes.
                </li>
                <div class="img">
                  <img
                    src="../images/geography/water_wave.gif"
                    alt="Water Wave"
                    style="width: 100%"
                  />
                </div>
                <li>
                  Most of the waves are caused by the wind driving against
                  water. Waves are actually the energy, not the water as such,
                  which moves across the ocean surface. Water particles only
                  travel in a small circle as a wave passes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  This motion of the surface water seldom affects the stagnant
                  deep bottom water of the oceans.
                </li>
                <li>
                  As a wave approaches the beach, it slows down. This is due to
                  the friction occurring between the dynamic water and the sea
                  floor. And, when the depth of water is less than half the
                  wavelength of the wave, the wave breaks.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The largest waves are found in the open oceans. Waves continue
                  to grow larger as they move and absorb energy from the wind.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Tsunami</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  An earthquake, a volcanic eruption or underwater landslides
                  can shift large amounts of ocean water. As a result a huge
                  tidal wave called <b>tsunami</b>, that may be as high as 15m.,
                  is formed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The word 'tsunami' stands for 'harbour wave' in japanese, as
                  they almost always destroys ships along the harbour.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The <b>2004 Indian Ocean tsunami</b> was among the deadliest
                  natural disasters in human history, with at least 230,000
                  people killed or missing in 14 countries bordering the Indian
                  Ocean. It was caused by an earthquake which inturn is caused
                  by a rupture along the fault between the Burma Plate and the
                  Indian Plate.

              <h2>Tides</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Tides are the the periodical/rhythmic rise and fall of the
                  ocean water, once or twice a day, mainly due to the attraction
                  of the sun and the moon, and the rotation of the Earth.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The moon’s gravitational pull to a great extent and to a
                  lesser extent the sun’s gravitational pull, are the major
                  causes for the occurrence of tides. Another factor is
                  centrifugal force formed due to earth's rotation which acts to
                  counter balance the gravity.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Together, the gravitational pull and the centrifugal force are
                  responsible for creating the two major tidal bulges on the
                  earth. On the side of the earth facing the moon, a tidal bulge
                  occurs while on the opposite side though the gravitational
                  attraction of the moon is less as it is farther away, the
                  centrifugal force causes tidal bulge on the other side.

                </li>
                <li>
                  The tidal bulges on wide continental shelves, have greater
                  height. When tidal bulges hit the mid-oceanic islands they
                  become low. The shape of bays and estuaries along a coastline
                  can also magnify the intensity of tides. Funnel-shaped bays
                  greatly change tidal magnitudes. When the tide is channelled
                  between islands or into bays and estuaries they are called
                  <b>tidal currents</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Note:</b> The highest tides in the world occur in the
                  <b>Bay of Fundy</b> in Nova Scotia, Canada. The tidal bulge is
                  15 - 16 m.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <div class="note">
                While tides are usually the largest source of short-term
                sea-level fluctuations, sea levels are also subject to forces
                such as wind and barometric pressure changes, resulting in
                <b>storm surges</b>, especially in shallow seas and near coasts.

              <h3>Types of Tides</h3>
              <p>
                <b>Tides based on Frequency</b>
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Semi-diurnal tide:</b> The most common tidal pattern,
                  featuring two high tides and two low tides each day. The
                  successive high or low tides are approximately of the same
                  height.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Diurnal tide:</b> There is only one high tide and one low
                  tide during each day. The successive high and low tides are
                  approximately of the same height.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Mixed tide:</b> Tides having variations in height are known
                  as mixed tides. These tides generally occur along the west
                  coast of North America and on many islands of the Pacific
                  Ocean.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                <b> Tides based on the Sun, Moon and the Earth Positions </b>
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Spring tides:</b> When the sun, the moon and the earth are
                  in a straight line, the height of the tide will be higher.
                  These are called spring tides and they occur twice a month,
                  one on full moon period and another during new moon period.
                </li>
                <div class="img">
                  <img

                    alt="Spring and Neap tides"
                    style="width: 100%"
                  />
                </div>
                <li>
                  <b>Neap tides:</b> Normally, there is a seven day interval
                  between the spring tides and neap tides. At this time the sun
                  and moon are at right angles to each other and the forces of
                  the sun and moon tend to counteract one another.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Once in a month, when the moon’s orbit is closest to the earth
                  (perigee), unusually high and low tides occur. During this
                  time the tidal range is greater than normal. Two weeks later,
                  when the moon is farthest from earth (apogee), the moon’s
                  gravitational force is limited and the tidal ranges are less
                  than their average heights.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When the earth is closest to the sun (perihelion), around 3rd
                  January each year, tidal ranges are also much greater, with
                  unusually high and unusually low tides. When the earth is
                  farthest from the sun (aphelion), around 4th July each year,
                  tidal ranges are much less than average.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The time between the high tide and low tide, when the water
                  level is falling, is called the <b>ebb</b>. The time between
                  the low tide and high tide, when the tide is rising, is called
                  the <b>flow</b> or <b>flood</b>.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Importance of Tides</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Since tides are caused by the earth-moon-sun positions which
                  are known accurately, the tides can be predicted well in
                  advance. This helps the navigators and fishermen plan their
                  activities.
                </li>
                <li>
                  High tides help in navigation. They raise the water level
                  close to the shores. This helps the ships to arrive at the
                  harbour more easily
                </li>
                <li>
                  Tides are also helpful in desilting the sediments and in
                  removing polluted water from river estuaries.
                </li>
                <li>Tides are used to generate electrical power.</li>

              <h2>Ocean Currents</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                Ocean currents are like river flow in oceans. They represent a
                regular volume of water in a definite path and direction.
              </p>

              <p>
                <b> Factors that influence the currents: </b>
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Heating by solar energy</b>: Heating by solar energy causes
                  the water to expand. That is why, near the equator the ocean
                  water is about 8 cm higher in level than in the middle
                  latitudes. This causes a very slight gradient and water tends
                  to flow down the slope.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Wind:</b> Wind blowing on the surface of the ocean pushes
                  the water to move. Friction between the wind and the water
                  surface affects the movement of the water body in its course.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Gravity</b>: Gravity tends to pull the water down the pile
                  and create gradient variation.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Coriolis force:</b> The Coriolis force intervenes and
                  causes the water to move to the right in the northern
                  hemisphere and to the left in the southern hemisphere. These
                  large accumulations of water and the flow around them are
                  called <b>Gyres</b>. These produce large circular currents in
                  all the ocean basins.

                </div>
                <li>
                  <b>Density, Salinity and Temperature:</b> Differences in water
                  density affect vertical mobility of ocean currents. Water with
                  high salinity is denser than water with low salinity and in
                  the same way cold water is denser than warm water. Denser
                  water tends to sink, while relatively lighter water tends to
                  rise. Cold-water ocean currents occur when the cold water at
                  the poles sinks and slowly moves towards the equator.
                  Warm-water currents travel out from the equator along the
                  surface, flowing towards the poles to replace the sinking cold
                  water.

                <b>Characteristics of Ocean Currents</b>
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Usually, the currents are strongest near the surface and may
                  attain speeds over five knots. At depths, currents are
                  generally slow with speeds less than 0.5 knots.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We refer to the speed of a current as its <b>“drift”</b>.
                  Drift is measured in terms of knots.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The strength of a current refers to the speed of the current.
                  A fast current is considered strong. A current is usually
                  strongest at the surface and decreases in strength (speed)
                  with depth. Most currents have speeds less than or equal to 5
                  knots.
                </li>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Surface currents</b> constitute about 10 per cent of all
                  the water in the ocean, these waters are the upper 400 m of
                  the ocean.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Deep water currents</b> make up the other 90 per cent of
                  the ocean water. These waters move around the ocean basins due
                  to variations in the density and gravity.
                </li>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Cold currents</b> bring cold water into warm water areas.
                  These currents are usually found on the west coast of the
                  continents in the low and middle latitudes (true in both
                  hemispheres) and on the east coast in the higher latitudes in
                  the Northern Hemisphere. Ex: Labrodor Current., Oyashio
                  Current, California Current etc.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Warm currents</b> bring warm water into cold water areas
                  and are usually observed on the east coast of continents in
                  the low and middle latitudes (true in both hemispheres). In
                  the northern hemisphere they are found on the west coasts of
                  continents in high latitudes. Ex: Gulf Stream, North Atlantic
                  Drift etc.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Effects of Ocean Currents</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The ocean current influence the temperature conditions of the
                  area. Warm currents bring about warm temperature over land
                  surface.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The mixing of warm and cold currents help to replenish the
                  oxygen and favour the growth of planktons, the primary food
                  for fish population. The best fishing grounds of the world
                  exist mainly in these mixing zones. Seas around Japan and the
                  eastern coast of North America are such examples. The areas
                  where a warm and cold current meet also experience foggy
                  weather making it difficult for navigation.
