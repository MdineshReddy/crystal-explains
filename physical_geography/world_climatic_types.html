              <h1 class="title">World Climatic Types</h1>
              <p>
                Before we try and learn about world climatic types, we need to
                understand that Weather and Climate are not the same thing.
                Weather is what’s going on in the atmosphere at any given time
                and place. Today it’s dry and sunny but tomorrow it may be
                cloudy and rainy. Weather happens in the short term and is
                difficult to predict.
              </p>
              <p>
                But climate is a region’s average weather over many years, which
                is much more predictable and based on trends. So we don’t know
                what the weather will be like in New Delhi on January 20th,
                2025, but we do know that it's usually chilly, because in
                January it is winter in Northern hemisphere.
              </p>

                  Dr. J. Marshall Shepherd, President of the American
                  Meteorological Society, summed up the distinction between
                  Weather and Climate as "Weather is your mood, climate is your
                  personality".
                </p>

              <h2>Koppen climate classification</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                The Koppen climate classification is one of the most widely used
                climate classification systems, first published by
                German-Russian botanist and climatologist Wladimir Köppenin in
                1884. Later, the climatologist Rudolf Geiger introduced some
                changes to the classification system, which is thus sometimes
                called the
                <b>Köppen–Geiger climate classification system</b>. It's still
                widely used today with many improvements by many people.
              </p>
              <p>
                Koeppen identified a close relationship between the distribution
                of vegetation and climate. Specifically, the Koppen system
                divides the world into six major climate categories. Using the
                visible vegetation as a guide, Koppen came up with precise
                definitions for each climate region based on average monthly
                temperature, average monthly precipitation and total annual
                rainfall.
              </p>
              <p>
                * Original Koppen system included only 5 climate categoies. H
                Climate was added in Köppen–Geiger System.

                winter dry season and s - summer dry season. For example, Af
                indicates a tropical wet (or rainforest) climate.

                The system assigns a temperature subgroup for all groups other
                than those in the A group, indicated by the third letter for
                climates in B, C, and D, and the second letter for climates in
                E. The small letters a, b, c and d refer to the degree of
                severity of temperature in decreasing order. For example, Cfb
                indicates an oceanic climate with warm summers as indicated by
                the ending b.

                The B- Dry Climates are subdivided using the capital letters S
                for steppe or semi-arid and W for deserts.

              <h3>Group A : Tropical Humid Climates</h3>
              <p>
                Tropical humid climates exist between Tropic of Cancer and
                Tropic of Capricorn. The sun being overhead throughout the year
                and the presence of Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) make
                the climate hot and humid. Annual range of temperature is very
                low and annual rainfall is high. The tropical group is divided
                into three types as follows:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Tropical wet climate is found near the equator. The major
                  areas are the Amazon Basin in South America, western
                  equatorial Africa and the islands of East Indies.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Significant amount of rainfall occurs in every month of the
                  year as thunder showers in the afternoon.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The temperature is uniformly high and the annual range of
                  temperature is negligible. The maximum temperature on any day
                  is around 30°C while the minimum temperature is around 20°C.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Tropical evergreen forests with dense canopy cover and large
                  biodiversity are found in this climate.

                  Tropical monsoon climate (Am) is found over the Indian
                  sub-continent, North Eastern part of South America and
                  Northern Australia.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Tropical wet and dry climate occurs north and south of Af type
                  climate regions. It borders with dry climate on the western
                  part of the continent and Cf or Cw on the eastern part.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Extensive Aw climate is found to the north and south of the
                  Amazon forest in Brazil and adjoining parts of Bolivia and
                  Paraguay in South America, Sudan and south of Central Africa.

                <li>
                  The annual rainfall in this climate is considerably less than
                  that in Af and Am climate types and is variable also. The wet
                  season is shorter and the dry season is longer with the
                  drought being more severe.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Temperature is high throughout the year and diurnal ranges of
                  temperature are the greatest in the dry season.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Deciduous forest and tree-shredded grasslands occur in this

              </ul>
              <h3>Dry Climates : B</h3>
              <p>
                Dry climates are characterised by very low rainfall that is not
                adequate for the growth of plants. These climates cover a very
                large area of the planet extending over large latitudes from 15°
                - 60° north and south of the equator. It is classified as:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>BWh = Hot desert climate</li>
                <li>BWk = Cold desert climate</li>
                <li>BSh = Hot semi-arid climate</li>
                <li>BSk = Cold semi-arid climate</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                The variability in the rainfall affects the life in the steppe
                much more than in the desert, more often causing famine. Rain
                occurs in short intense thundershowers in deserts and is
                ineffective in building soil moisture. Fog is common in coastal
                deserts bordering cold currents.
              </p>
              <p>
                Maximum temperature in the summer is very high. The highest
                shade temperature of 58° C was recorded at Al Aziziyah, Libya on
                13 September 1922. The annual and diurnal ranges of temperature

              <h3>Warm Temperate (Mid-Latitude) Climates-C</h3>
              <p>
                Warm temperate (mid-latitude) climates extend from 30° - 50° of
                latitude mainly on the eastern and western margins of
                continents. These climates generally have warm summers with mild
                winters. They are grouped as follows:
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Mediterranean Climate (Cs)</b>
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Mediterranean climate occurs around Mediterranean sea, along
                  the west coast of continents in subtropical latitudes between
                  30° - 40° latitudes e.g. — Central California, Central Chile,
                  along the coast in south eastern and south western Australia.
                </li>
                <li>
                  These areas come under the influence of sub tropical high in
                  summer and westerly wind in winter. Hence, the climate is
                  characterised by hot, dry summer and mild, rainy winter.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Monthly average temperature in summer is around 25° C and in
                  winter below 10°C. The annual precipitation ranges between 35
                  - 90 cm.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p><b>Humid Subtropical (Cfa) Climate</b></p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Humid subtropical climate lies on the eastern parts of the
                  continent in subtropical latitudes. In this region the air
                  masses are generally unstable and cause rainfall throughout
                  the year.
                </li>
                <li>
                  They occur in eastern United States of America, southern and
                  eastern China, southern Japan, northeastern Argentina, coastal
                  south Africa and eastern coast of Australia.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Mean monthly temperature in summer is around 27°C, and in
                  winter it varies from 5°-12° C. The annual averages of
                  precipitation vary from 75-150 cm.

                <b> Marine West Coast Climate (Cfb) </b>
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Marine west coast climate is located poleward from the
                  Mediterranean climate on the west coast of the continents. The
                  main areas are: Northwestern Europe, west coast of North
                  America, north of California, southern Chile, southeastern
                  Australia and New Zealand.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Due to marine influence, the temperature is moderate and in
                  winter, it is warmer than for its latitude.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The mean temperature in summer months ranges from 15°-20°C and
                  in winter 4°-10°C. Precipitation occurs throughout the year.
                  Precipitation varies greatly from 50-250cm.

              <h3>Cold Snow Forest Climates (D)</h3>
              <p>
                Cold snow forest climates occur in the large continental area in
                the northern hemisphere between 40°-70° north latitudes in
                Europe, Asia and North America. Cold snow forest climates are
                divided as follows:
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Cold Climate with Humid Winters (Df)</b>
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Cold climate with humid winter occurs poleward of marine west
                  coast climate and mid latitude steppe.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The winters are cold and snowy. The frost free season is
                  short. The annual ranges of temperature are large. The weather
                  changes are abrupt and short. Poleward, the winters are more
                  severe.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                <b> Cold Climate with Dry Winters (Dw) </b>
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Cold climate with dry winter occurs mainly over Northeastern
                  Asia. The development of pronounced winter anti cyclone and
                  its weakening in summer sets in monsoon like reversal of wind
                  in this region.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Poleward summer temperatures are lower and winter temperatures
                  are extremely low with many locations experiencing below
                  freezing point temperatures for up to seven months in a year.
                  Precipitation occurs in summer. The annual precipitation is
                  low from 12-15 cm.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Polar Climates (E)</h3>
              <p>
                Polar climates exist poleward beyond 70° latitude. Polar
                climates consist of two types:
              </p>
              <p>
                <b> Tundra (ET) </b>
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The tundra climate (ET) is so called after the types of
                  vegetation, like low growing mosses, lichens and flowering
                  plants. This is the region of permafrost where the sub soil is
                  permanently frozen.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The short growing season and water logging support only low
                  growing plants. During summer, the tundra regions have very
                  long duration of day light.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                <b> Ice Cap Climate (EF) </b>
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The ice cap climate (EF) occurs over interior Greenland and
                  Antartica. Even in summer, the temperature is below freezing
                  point. This area receives very little precipitation.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The snow and ice get accumulated and the mounting pressure
                  causes the deformation of the ice sheets and they break. They
                  move as icebergs that float in the Arctic and Antarctic
                  waters.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Highland Climates (H)</h3>
              <p>
                Highland climates are governed by topography. In high mountains,
                large changes in mean temperature occur over short distances.
                Precipitation types and intensity also vary spatially across
                high lands. There is vertical zonation of layering of climatic
                types with elevation in the mountain environment.
