              <p>
                Water is an essential component of all life forms that exist
                over the surface of the earth. Water is a rare commodity in our
                solar system. The earth, fortunately has an abundant supply of
                water on its surface. Hence, our planet is called the
                <b>‘Blue Planet’</b>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Though water covers 71% of the Earth's surface, most of it is in
                seas and oceans and not suitable for drinking. The total volume
                of water on Earth is estimated at 1.388 billion km³, with 97.5%
                being salt water and 2.5% being fresh water.
              </p>

                <img

              <p>
                The water cycle or hydrological cycle refers to the continuous
                exchange of water within the hydrosphere, the atmosphere, soil
                water, surface water, groundwater, and plants in different forms
                i.e. the liquid, solid and the gaseous phases. The water cycle
                has been working for billions of years and all the life on earth
                depends on it.
              </p>
              <p>
                The distribution of water on earth is quite uneven. Many
                locations have plenty of water while others have very limited
                quantity. Renewable water on the earth is constant while the
                demand is increasing tremendously. This leads to water crisis in
                different parts of the world — spatially and temporally. The
                pollution of river waters has further aggravated the crisis.
              </p>
              <p>
                Water moves perpetually through each of these regions in the
                Water cycle consisting of the following transfer processes:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b> Evaporation</b>: Water at the surface gets heated up by
                  the Sun and forms water vapor which rises and condenses to
                  form Clouds. <b>Evapotranspiration</b> (or simply
                  transpiration) is a form of evaporation that occurs through
                  the plants. <b>Sublimation</b> is another variant of
                  evaporation, where snow or ice changes directly into water
                  vapour without becoming water.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Condensation</b>: The water vapour formed from the
                  evaporation, rises up, cools down and condenses to form
                  clouds.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Precipitation</b>: As the clouds capacity to hold water
                  reaches maximum, it comes down on to the earth as
                  precipitation i.e., rain, snow, hail etc.

                <li>
                  <b> Infiltration or Penetration</b>: Rainwater gets absorbed
                  into the ground through the process of infiltration. The level
                  of absorption varies based on the material the water has
                  seeped into. For instance, rocks will retain comparatively
                  less water than soil.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Runoff</b>: Rain water on the downslopes, sides of
                  mountains, hills etc. runoff due to gravity eventually
                  accumulate forming lakes, rivers, seas and oceans. Groundwater
                  can also flow (sub-surface runoff) into streams or rivers. But
                  sometimes, it might just sink deeper, forming aquifers.

              <h2>Temperature of ocean Waters</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                Ocean waters get heated up by the solar energy just as land. The
                process of heating and cooling of the oceanic water is slower
                than land.
              </p>
              <h3>Factors Affecting Temperature Distribution</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Latitude:</b> the temperature of surface water decreases
                  from the equator towards the poles because the amount of
                  insolation decreases poleward.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b> Unequal distribution of land and water: </b> the oceans in
                  the northern hemisphere receive more heat due to their contact
                  with larger extent of land than the oceans in the southern
                  hemisphere.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b> Prevailing wind: </b> the winds blowing from the land
                  towards the oceans drive warm surface water away form the
                  coast resulting in the upwelling of cold water from below. It
                  results into the longitudinal variation in the temperature.
                  Contrary to this, the onshore winds pile up warm water near
                  the coast and this raises the temperature.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Ocean currents:</b> warm ocean currents raise the
                  temperature in cold areas while the cold currents decrease the
                  temperature in warm ocean areas. Gulf stream (warm current)
                  raises the temperature near the eastern coast of North America
                  and the West Coast of Europe while the Labrador current (cold
                  current) lowers the temperature near the north-east coast of
                  North America.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b> Depth of the Ocean:</b> Maximum temperature of the oceans
                  is always at their surfaces because they directly receive the
                  heat from the sun and the heat is transmitted to the lower
                  sections of the oceans through the process of convection. It
                  results into decrease of temperature with the increasing
                  depth, but the rate of decrease is not uniform throughout. The
                  temperature falls very rapidly up to the depth of 200 m and
                  thereafter, the rate of decrease of temperature is slowed
                  down.

              <h2>Salinity of Ocean Water</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                All waters in nature, whether rain water or ocean water, contain
                dissolved mineral salts. Salinity is the term used to define the
                total content of dissolved salts in sea water.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is calculated as the amount of salt (in gm) dissolved in
                1,000 gm (1 kg) of seawater. It is usually expressed as parts
                per thousand or ppt. Salinity is an important property of sea
                water. Salinity of 24.7 ppt has been considered as the upper
                limit to demarcate ‘brackish water’.
              </p>
              <p>The average salinity of Indian Ocean is 35 ppt.</p>
              <h3>Factors affecting ocean salinity</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The salinity of water in the surface layer of oceans depend
                  mainly on evaporation and precipitation.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Surface salinity is greatly influenced in coastal regions by
                  the fresh water flow from rivers, and in polar regions by the
                  processes of freezing and thawing of ice.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Wind and ocean currents also influences salinity of an area by
                  transferring water to other areas.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Salinity, temperature and density of water are interrelated.
                Hence, any change in the temperature or density influences the
                salinity of water in an area
