              <p>
                As you might have known, hot air expands and rises, while cool
                air contracts and sinks. This results in variations in the
                atmospheric pressure. As hot air rises, it creates a low
                pressure area and cool air from surrounding high pressure area
                quickly moves to fill up this low pressure area.
              </p>
              <div class="img">
                <img
                  src="../images/geography/wind_movement.jpg"
                  alt="Wind"
                  style="width: 100%"
                />
              </div>

              <p>
                This horizontal motion of air from high pressure to low pressure
                is called <b>wind</b>. Winds redistribute the heat and moisture
                across the planet, thereby, maintaining a constant temperature
                for the planet as a whole. Winds are named based on what
                direction they come from. Example: Westerlies are prevailing
                winds that blow from west to east in between 30 and 60 degree
                latitudes.
              </p>
              <h3>Atmospheric Pressure</h3>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                Air (or Atmosphere) has weight and its exerts pressure on our
                bodies all the time. We don’t crumple like aluminum cans under
                this enormous pressure because the air and water inside us exert
                an equal amount of pressure outwards.
              </p>
              <p>
                The weight of a column of air contained in a unit area (from the
                mean sea level to the top of the atmosphere) is called the
                <b>atmospheric pressure</b>.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Measurement</b>: Atmospheric pressure is commonly measured
                with a <b>barometer</b>. In a barometer, a column of mercury in
                a glass tube rises or falls as the weight of the atmosphere
                changes. Meteorologists describe the atmospheric pressure by how
                high the mercury rises. An atmosphere (atm) is a unit of
                measurement equal to the average air pressure at sea level at a
                temperature of 15 degrees Celsius. One atmosphere is 1,013.2
                millibars, or 760 millimeters (29.92 inches) of mercury.
              </p>
              <p>
                As we move upwards i.e., as the elevation increases, there is
                less overlying atmospheric mass, so that atmospheric pressure
                decreases with increasing elevation.
              </p>
              <div class="note">
                <p>
                  Mountain climbers use bottled oxygen when they ascend very
                  high peaks. They also take time to get used to the altitude
                  because quickly moving from higher pressure to lower pressure
                  can cause decompression sickness. Decompression sickness, also
                  called "the bends", is also a problem for scuba divers who
                  come to the surface too quickly.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Aircraft create artificial pressure in the cabin so passengers
                  remain comfortable while flying.
                </p>
              </div>
              <h3>Vertical Variation of Pressure</h3>
              <p>
                In the lower atmosphere the pressure decreases rapidly with
                height. This is because - Due to gravity, air at the surface is
                denser and hence has higher pressure. As we move upwards, the
                pressure still decreases but at a slow rate since the density of
                air decreases as we move upwards.
              </p>
              <div class="note">
                <p>
                  <b
                    >Since Pressure decreases as we go upwards, then why aren't
                    there strong upward winds?</b
                  >
                  The vertical pressure gradient force is much larger than that
                  of the horizontal pressure gradient. But, it is generally
                  balanced by a nearly equal but opposite gravitational force.
                  Hence, we do not experience strong upward winds.
                </p>
              </div>

              <h3>Horizontal Distribution of Pressure</h3>
              <p>
                Horizontal distribution of pressure is studied by drawing
                isobars at constant levels. <b>Isobars</b> are lines connecting
                places at same level having equal pressure.
              </p>

                  A weather report on TV might show a map full of H’s and L’s,
                  which is actually a map tracking air pressure. A giant L
                  stands for low pressure, or a low. On a global scale, a low is
                  an area where the pressure near the surface is less than
                  standard sea level pressure. But on a local scale like on your
                  local weather report, a low can also be an area where the
                  pressure is less than in the surrounding area because there’s
                  actually slightly less air pressing down on that part of the
                  Earth.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Lows exist either because air is being heated and expands up
                  and out, or air higher up in the atmosphere is spreading out,
                  so there’s less air pressing down on Earth’s surface. Down on
                  the ground, we might even be able to tell we’re in a low. As
                  air expands and rises, winds are drawn towards the center. The
                  rising air cools, and moisture in the air condenses into
                  droplets. So if we happen to be in the center of a low, the
                  weather would often be pretty cloudy and rainy.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Lows go by lots of names. Like you might hear it called a
                  <b>depression</b> or even a <b>cyclone</b>. Though it’s not
                  the giant spinning vortex of air we might think of -- that’s a
                  specific weather event that only forms in tropical oceans. But
                  we’ll look at that in
                  <a href='/physical_geography/cyclones.html'>Cyclones article</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The giant H’s on the map mark high pressure areas, which we
                  call a high or <b>anticyclone</b>. In a high pressure cell,
                  either the air is cooling and becoming denser, so it sinks, or
                  the atmosphere high above is piling up, pushing the air below
                  it downward. Sinking compresses air molecules together and
                  makes them warm. So any water vapor in the air won’t cool to
                  condense into liquid water. That means high pressure systems
                  bring weather that’s clear and sunny.

              <h3>Forces Affecting the Velocity and Direction of Wind</h3>
              <p>
                The wind blows from high pressure to low pressure. The wind at
                the surface experiences friction. In addition, rotation of the
                earth also affects the wind movement. The force exerted by the
                rotation of the earth is known as the Coriolis force.
              </p>
              <p>
                Thus, the horizontal winds near the earth surface respond to the
                combined effect of three forces – the pressure gradient force,
                the frictional force and the Coriolis force. In addition, the
                gravitational force acts downward
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Pressure Gradient Force</b>: The rate of change of pressure
                  with respect to distance is the pressure gradient. The
                  pressure gradient is strong where the isobars are close to
                  each other and is weak where the isobars are apart.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Frictional Force</b>: It affects the speed of the wind. It
                  is greatest at the surface and its influence generally extends
                  upto an elevation of 1 - 3 km. Over the sea surface the
                  friction is minimal.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Coriolis Force</b>: is the force generated due to
                  variations in rotational speeds of earth at equator and poles.
                  It acts as a deflective force to the wind direction. Because
                  of the Coriolis force, all winds are deflected to the right in
                  the Northern Hemisphere while they are deflected to the left
                  in the southern Hemisphere with respect to the rotating earth.
                  This force is absent along the equator and increases
                  progressively towards the poles. It plays a signficant role in
                  atmospheric circulation.
                </li>

              <p><b>Equatorial Low-Pressure Belt</b></p>
              <p>
                Air at the equator is consistently warmed by the Sun and tends
                to expand and rise, so we get a belt of low pressure around the
                Earth called the equatorial trough or low.
              </p>
              <p>
                This region is also referred to as the
                <b>intertropical convergence zone</b>, as the Easterly Trade
                Winds converge here and rise. The surface winds, or
                <b>doldrums</b>, that form here as the air converges and rises
                upwards are light and not reliable. Sailing ships could get
                stuck in the doldrums for days.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b> Subtropical Highs </b>
              </p>
              <p>
                The heated air at the equator first rises upward towards the
                tropopause, which is the boundary between the troposphere and
                the stratosphere, as it tries to move poleward, high up in the
                atmosphere. The air is also cooling, and by the time it sinks
                back to the surface, it’s only reached around 30 degrees
                latitude. This sinking cool air creates subtropical high
                pressure belts.
              </p>
              <p>
                This closed circulation loop between equatorial low and
                subtropical high pressure belts is called <b>Hadley cell</b>.
              </p>
              <div class="note">
                Sailors of yore, were often forced to eat their horses or throw
                them overboard in these <b>“horse latitudes”</b> to conserve
                drinking water and lighten the weight while the sailing ships
                waited for the weak winds at the center of these highs to pick
                up.
              </div>
              <p>
                In between these high and low pressure belts, there are strong
                and reliable winds spiraling outwards from the subtropical high
                pressure belt towards the equator. These are the easterly Trade
                Winds. Many ships have depended on the trade winds, like early
                Spanish sailing ships as they sought God, glory, and gold in
                what we now call Central and South America. Of course, making
                the return trip was another matter.

                <b> Sub Polar Lows and Polar Highs</b>
              </p>
              <p>
                As the air sinks towards the surface near the the Subtropical
                Highs, it gets divided into two parts, one part of the wind
                (easterlies) heads back to the equator and the other goes
                towards the pole (westerlies).
              </p>
              <p>
                The ancient mariners of the Spanish galleons going home from the
                Americas plotted a course using the winds blowing poleward from
                the subtropical high pressure belt. These Westerlies are
                strongly deflected to the right and blow from the southwest.
              </p>
              <p>
                These strong winds blow towards another low pressure belt called
                the <b>subpolar lows</b> where they clash with the polar
                Easterlies blowing from the frigid, very
                <b>high pressure poles</b>.
              </p>
              <p>
                This circulation loop between sub-tropical high and sub-polar
                low pressure belts is called <b>ferrel cell</b> and the
                circulation loop between sub-polar low and polar high is called
                <b>polar cell</b>. Compared to other two cells, Ferrel cell is
                weak whose existence depends upon the Hadley and polar cells on
                either side of it.
              </p>
              <p>
                So altogether, on our idealized Earth we’ve seen that there are
                actually seven pressure belts: two polar highs, two subpolar
                lows, two subtropical highs and one equatorial low. And winds
                flow between these belts of high and low pressure.
              </p>
              <p>
                On the real Earth, the belts are not so organized. They form
                cells of pressure and we see more complex patterns of pressure
                and wind, as the cells shift with the seasons and vary between
                land and water.

              <div class="underline"></div>
              <h3>Air Masses</h3>
              <p>
                Air masses are vast bodies of air with similar temperature and
                humidity that form over a region. Like when an air mass forms
                over tropical oceans it will be relatively warmer and more humid
                than one that forms over the frigid interior of northern Canada,
                which will be cold and very dry. And as they move, they bring
                their temperatures and moisture with them. The surfaces, over
                which air masses form, are called the <b>source regions</b>.
              </p>
              <p>
                The air masses are classified according to the source regions.
                There are five major source regions. These are:

              <p>
                When two different air masses meet, the boundary zone between
                them is called a front. The process of formation of the fronts
                is known as <b>frontogenesis</b>.
              </p>
              <p>There are four types of fronts:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Cold front</b>: When the cold air mass is moves towards a
                  warm air mass, we get a cold front. The nose of the advancing
                  cold front is like a snow plow, hugging the surface because
                  it's dense and heavy, pushing the warm air out of the way, and
                  flinging it upward. And with a cold front comes shifting
                  winds, dropping temperatures, and lowering pressure. If the
                  displaced warm air is unstable and wants to rise and has lots
                  of moisture, we’ll get heavy rain from thunderstorms and an
                  advancing wall of cumulus and cumulonimbus clouds.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Warm front:</b> When the warm air mass moves towards the
                  cold air mass, we get a warm front. The warm air can’t
                  displace the denser, colder air near the ground, so the warm
                  front slides over it like a thick blanket. Overall, a warm
                  front is much less sudden and violent than a cold front and
                  tends to linger, leaving warm, wet air behind. The first sign
                  of one is high cirrus clouds, followed by lower and thicker
                  altostratus clouds, and then still lower and thicker stratus
                  clouds that bring drizzly rain.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Stationary front</b>: When the front remains stationary, it
                  is called a stationary front.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Occluded front</b>: If an air mass is fully lifted above
                  the land surface, it is called the occluded front.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The fronts occur in middle latitudes and are characterised by
                steep gradient in temperature and pressure. They bring abrupt
                changes in temperature and cause the air to rise to form clouds
                and cause precipitation.
