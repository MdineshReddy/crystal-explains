              <h3>Components of the Preamble</h3>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                Broadly, the Preamble reveals following four components of the
                Indian Constitution:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Source of authority of the Constitution:</b> The
                  Constitution derives its authority from the people of India.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Nature of Indian State:</b> It declares India to be a
                  Sovereign, Socialist, Secular, Democratic and Republican
                  polity.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Objectives of the Constitution:</b> It specifies Justice,
                  Liberty, Equality and Fraternity as the objectives.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Date of adoption of the Constitution:</b> November 26, 1949
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h2>Important Terms in the Preamble</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <h3>Sovereign</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The word ‘sovereign’ signifies that
                  <b
                    >India is neither a dependency nor a dominion of any other
                    nation, but an independent state</b
                  >. There is no authority above it, and it is free to conduct
                  its own affairs (both internal and external).
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Socialist</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  This term was added by the 42nd Amendment in 1976. Even prior
                  to that the Constitution had a socialist content in the form
                  of certain Directive Principles of State Policy.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Indian brand of socialism is a
                  <b>‘democratic socialism’</b> and not a
                  <b>‘communistic/state socialism’</b> (of erstwhile USSR and
                  China) which involves the nationalisation of all means of
                  production and distribution and the abolition of private
                  property.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Democratic socialism, on the other hand, holds faith in a
                  ‘mixed economy’ where both public and private sectors co-exist
                  side by side.
                </li>
                <li>
                  As the Supreme Court says, ‘Democratic socialism aims to end
                  poverty, ignorance, disease and inequality of opportunity.’
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Secular</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>This term was added by the 42nd Amendment in 1976.</li>
                <li>
                  It indicates that all religions (irrespective of their
                  strength) have equal protection, support, and respect from the
                  state.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Democratic</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  This word signifies that the Constitution has established a
                  form of Government which gets its authority from the
                  <b>will of the people</b>. The rulers are elected by the
                  people and are responsible to them.
                </li>
                <li>Democracy is of two types–direct and indirect.</li>
                <ul style="list-style-type: square">
                  <li>
                    In direct democracy, the people exercise their supreme power
                    directly as is the case in Switzerland.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    In indirect democracy, on the other hand, the
                    representatives elected by the people exercise the supreme
                    power and thus carry on the government and make the laws.
                    This type of democracy, also known as representative
                    democracy, is of two kinds–<b>parliamentary</b> and
                    <b>presidential.</b>
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <li>
                  The Indian Constitution provides for
                  <b>representative parliamentary democracy</b> under which the
                  executive is responsible to the legislature for all its
                  policies and actions.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Republic</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  As opposed to a monarchy (e.g., the Britain), in which the
                  head of state is appointed on the hereditary basis for a
                  lifetime or until he/she abdicates the throne, in a democratic
                  republic the
                  <b>head of state is elected, directly or indirectly</b>, for a
                  fixed tenure (e.g., USA, India).
                </li>
                <li>
                  The President of India is elected by an electoral college for
                  a term of five years. The post of the President Of India is
                  not hereditary. Every citizen of India is eligible to become
                  the President of the country.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Justice</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>The word “Justice” embraces three distinct forms:</li>
                <ul style="list-style-type: square">
                  <li>
                    <b>Social justice</b> denotes the equal treatment of all
                    citizens without any social distinction based on caste,
                    colour, race, religion, sex and so on.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Economic justice</b> denotes the non-discrimination
                    between people on the basis of economic factors (wealth).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Political justice</b> implies that all citizens should
                    have equal political rights, equal access to all political
                    offices and equal voice in the government.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </ul>
              <div class="note">
                <p>
                  <b>Note:</b> The ideal of justice–social, economic and
                  political–has been taken from the
                  <b>Russian Revolution (1917)</b>.
                </p>
              </div>

              <h3>Liberty</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The term ‘liberty’ means the <b>absence of restraints</b> on
                  the activities of individuals, and at the same time, providing
                  opportunities for the development of individual personalities.
                </li>
                <li>
                  However, liberty does not mean ‘license’ to do what one likes,
                  and has to be enjoyed within the limitations mentioned in the
                  Constitution itself.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Equality</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The term ‘equality’ means the absence of special privileges to
                  any section of the society, and the provision of adequate
                  opportunities for all individuals without any discrimination.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Fraternity</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Fraternity means a <b>sense of brotherhood</b>. The Preamble
                  declares that fraternity has to assure two things– the dignity
                  of the individual and the unity and integrity of the nation.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The word ‘integrity’ has been added to the preamble by the
                  42nd Constitutional Amendment (1976).
                </li>
              </ul>
              <div class="note">
                <p>
                  <b>Note:</b> The ideals of liberty, equality and fraternity in
                  our Preamble have been taken from the
                  <b>French Revolution (1789–1799)</b>.
                </p>
              </div>

              <h2>Significance of Preamble</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The Preamble is very important for the Constitution of India.
                  The Preamble has been referred to as the
                  <b>‘‘key to the minds of the makers of the Constitution.’’</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Preamble contains the basic philosophy on which the
                  Constitution is based. It reflects vision, ideals and
                  aspirations of the framers of the Constitution of India.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h2>Whether Preamble is a Part of the Constitution?</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                The relationship of Preamble with the Constitution and its
                amendability has always been a matter of debate. The Supreme
                Court of India has given different judgements in different
                matters:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  In 1960, in the <b>Berubari Union Case</b>, the Supreme Court
                  established that the Preamble is key to the minds of the
                  framers of the Constitution, but it is
                  <b>not part of the Constitution</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In <b>Keshavanand Bharati Case</b> 1973, the Supreme Court
                  observed that the Preamble is an integral
                  <b>part of the Constitution</b>.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                Now, it is widely agreed that the Preamble is an integral part
                of the Constitution but it provisions are
                <b>not enforceable in the court of law</b>.
              </p>
              <h2>Amendability of the Preamble</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  In the Keshavanand Bharati Case, 1973, the Supreme Court
                  observed that as Preamble is part of Constitution therefore,
                  it is
                  <b>amendable</b> like any other part. But, no amendment can be
                  made to the basic features as mentioned in the Preamble.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In 1976, through <b>42nd Constitutional Amendment Act</b> ,
                  the Preamble was amended where words-socialist, secular and
                  integrity were added to it.
                </li>
