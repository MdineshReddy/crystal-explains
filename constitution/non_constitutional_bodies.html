              <p>
                Non Constitutional bodies are those that are not mentioned in
                the constitution. They are either created by an act of
                legislature (i.e., a statutory body) or by an executive action
                or resolution (i.e, an executive body).
              </p>
              <p>The Non Constitutional Bodies include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>NITI Aayog</li>
                <li>National Human Rights Commission</li>

                  NITI Aayog was established on January 1, 2015 as a successor
                  to the Planning commission (which formulated India’s Five-Year
                  Plans).
                </li>
                <li>
                  NITI Aayog, like that of the Planning Commission, was also
                  created by an executive resolution of the Government of India
                  (i.e., Union Cabinet). Hence, it is also neither a
                  constitutional body nor a statutory body.
                </li>
                <li>
                  NITI Aayog is the premier policy ‘Think Tank’ of the
                  Government of India, providing both directional and policy
                  inputs.
