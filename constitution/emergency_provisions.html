              <div class="underline"></div>
              <h3>Proclamation of National Emergency</h3>
              <p>
                Under Article 352, president can declare National Emergency when
                there is a
                <b> war or an external aggression or an armed rebellion</b>.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Important points to note:</b>
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  President can declare National Emergency even in
                  <b>anticipation</b> of War, External Aggression or Armed
                  Rebellion.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The President, however, can proclaim a national emergency only
                  after receiving a
                  <b>written recommendation from the cabinet</b> . This means
                  that the emergency can be declared only on the concurrence of
                  the cabinet and not merely on the advice of the prime
                  minister.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A proclamation of national emergency may be applicable to the
                  entire country or only a part of it. The 42nd Amendment Act of
                  1976 enabled the president to limit the operation of a
                  National Emergency to a specified part of India.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Types of National Emergency</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  When National emergency is imposed on the grounds of war or
                  external aggression it is called an <b>External emergency</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When national emergency is imposed on the grounds of armed
                  rebellion, we call it
                  <b> internal emergency</b>.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p></p>
              <h3>Parliamentary Approval</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The proclamation of Emergency must be approved by both the
                  Houses of Parliament and that too by
                  <b> special majority</b> (2/3 rd. of Present and Voting and
                  majority of total strength of the house)
                  <b>within one month</b> from the date of its issue.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If approved, this national emergency will continue for
                  <b>six months</b> .
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Duration</h3>
              <p>
                If approved by both the Houses of Parliament, the emergency
                continues for six months, and can be extended to an indefinite
                period with an approval of the Parliament for every six months.
                There is
                <b> no upper time limit</b>
                national emergency.
              </p>
              <h3>Revocation</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  National emergency can be revoked at any point in time by the
                  president but the president cannot act on his own. President
                  has to abide by the advice rendered by prime minister and his
                  council of ministers.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Further, the President must revoke a proclamation if the Lok
                  Sabha passes a resolution disapproving its continuation.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In this context, an exclusive power has been given to Lok
                  Sabha under article 352 clause 8. That is <b>one tenth</b> of
                  the Lok Sabha MPs can write to the speaker of Lok Sabha (if
                  Lok Sabha is in session) or the President (if Lok Sabha is not
                  in session) to convene a special sitting of Lok Sabha to
                  discuss national emergency. Then if a resolution is passed by
                  Lok Sabha that too by simple majority to revoke the national
                  emergency then it is binding on the president to revoke
                  national emergency. This power is not given to Rajya Sabha.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Effect on the Centre-State Relations</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  During a national emergency, the executive power of the Centre
                  extends to directing any state regarding the manner in which
                  its executive power is to be exercised. I
                </li>
                <li>
                  During a national emergency, the Parliament becomes empowered
                  to make laws on any subject mentioned in the State List.
                  Although the legislative power of a state legislature is not
                  suspended, it becomes subject to the overriding power of the
                  Parliament.
                </li>
                <li>
                  While a proclamation of national emergency is in operation,
                  the President can modify the constitutional distribution of
                  revenues between the centre and the states.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Effect on the Life of the Lok Sabha and State Assembly</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  While a proclamation of National Emergency is in operation,
                  the life of the Lok Sabha may be extended beyond its normal
                  term (five years) by a law of Parliament for one year at a
                  time (for any length of time), subject to a maximum period of
                  six months after the Emergency has ceased to operate
                </li>
                <li>
                  Similarly, the Parliament may extend the normal tenure of a
                  state legislative assembly (five years) by one year each time
                  (for any length of time) during a national emergency, subject
                  to a maximum period of six months after the Emergency has
                  ceased to operate.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Effect on the Fundamental Rights</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  When national emergency is imposed on the grounds of war or
                  external aggression, the six Fundamental Rights under article
                  19 are automatically suspended.
                </li>
                <li>
                  But when national emergency is imposed on the grounds of armed
                  rebellion, article 19 is not automatically suspended. Then
                  president has to issue an order under article 359 and suspend
                  article 19 and one by one all fundamental rights can be
                  suspended when president issues an order under article 359.
                </li>
                <li>
                  But there are two fundamental rights which will not be
                  suspended at all and these two fundamental rights are article
                  20 and 21.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Scope of Judicial Review</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The 38th Amendment Act of 1975 made the declaration of a
                  National Emergency immune from the judicial review.
                </li>
                <li>
                  But this provision was subsequently deleted by the 44th
                  Amendment Act of 1978. Further, in the Minerva Mills case,
                  (1980), the Supreme Court held that the proclamation of a
                  national emergency can be challenged in a court on the ground
                  of malafide or that the declaration was based on wholly
                  extraneous and irrelevant facts or is absurd or perverse.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <div class="underline"></div>
              <h3>Grounds of Impositions</h3>
              <p>
                The Presidentâ€™s Rule can be proclaimed under Article 356 on two
                grounds:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Article 356 empowers the President to issue a proclamation, if
                  he is satisfied that a situation has arisen in which the
                  government of a state cannot be carried on in accordance with
                  the provisions of the Constitution. Notably, the president can
                  act either on a report of the governor of the state or
                  otherwise too (i.e., even without the governorâ€™s report).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Article 365 says that whenever a state fails to comply with or
                  to give effect to any direction from the Centre, it will be
                  lawful for the president to hold that a situation has arisen
                  in which the government of the state cannot be carried on in
                  accordance with the provisions of the Constitution.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                A proclamation of National Emergency should be in operation in
                the whole of India, or in the whole or any part of the state.
              </p>
              <h3>Parliamentary Approval</h3>
              <p>
                A proclamation imposing Presidentâ€™s Rule must be approved by
                both the Houses of Parliament by a <b>simple majority</b> within
                <b>two months</b> from the date of its issue. If approved by
                both the Houses of Parliament, the Presidentâ€™s Rule continues
                for six months.
              </p>
              <h3>Duration</h3>
              <p>
                If approved by both the Houses of Parliament, the Presidentâ€™s
                Rule continues for <b> six months</b>. It can be extended for a
                <b>maximum period of three years</b> with the approval of the
                Parliament, every six months.
              </p>
              <h3>Consequences of Presidentâ€™s Rule</h3>
              <p>President has following powers during Presidents' rule:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  He can take up the functions of the state government and
                  powers vested in the governor or any other executive authority
                  in the state.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He can declare that the powers of the state legislature are to
                  be exercised by the Parliament.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He can take all other necessary steps including the suspension
                  of the constitutional provisions relating to anybody or
                  authority in the state.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Therefore, when the Presidentâ€™s Rule is imposed in a state, the
                President dismisses the state council of ministers headed by the
                chief minister. The state governor, on behalf of the President,
                carries on the state administration with the help of the chief
                secretary of the state or the advisors appointed by the
                President.
              </p>
              <h3>Revocation</h3>
              <p>
                Since Presidents rule is imposed on the advice on the PM and the
                CoMs(UNION) then it can be revoked by the President on the
                advice of them as well. Neither Lok Sabha nor Rajya Sabha can
                pass a resolution for its revocation.
              </p>
              <h3>Scope of Judicial Review</h3>
              <p>
                The 38th Amendment Act of 1975 made the satisfaction of the
                President in invoking Article 356 final and conclusive which
                could not be challenged in any court on any ground. But this
                provision was subsequently deleted by the 44th Amendment Act of
                1978 implying that the satisfaction of the President is not
                beyond judicial review.

              <h3>Grounds of Declaration</h3>
              <p>
                Article 360 empowers the president to proclaim a Financial
                Emergency if he is satisfied that a situation has arisen due to
                which the
                <b>
                  financial stability or credit of India or any part of its
                  territory is threatened.</b
                >
              </p>
              <h3>Parliamentary Approval</h3>
              <p>
                A proclamation declaring financial emergency must be approved by
                both the Houses of Parliament by a
                <b> simple majority</b> within <b>two months</b> from the date
                of its issue.
              </p>
              <h3>Duration</h3>
              <p>
                Once approved by both the Houses of Parliament, the Financial
                Emergency continues <b> indefinitely</b> till it is revoked.
                i.e.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  there is no maximum period prescribed for its operation and
                </li>
                <li>
                  repeated parliamentary approval is not required for its
                  continuation.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Effects of Financial Emergency</h3>

                <li>
                  The executive authority of the Centre extends to the giving of
                  (a) directions to any state to observe such canons of
                  financial propriety as may be specified in the directions; and
                  (b) such other directions to any state as the President may
                  deem necessary and adequate for the purpose.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Any such direction may include a provision requiring (a) the
                  reduction of salaries and allowances of all or any class of
                  persons serving in the state; and (b) the reservation of all
                  money bills or other financial bills for the consideration of

                  state.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The President may issue directions for the reduction of

              <h3>Scope of Judicial Review</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The 38th Amendment Act of 1975 made the satisfaction of the
                  president in declaring a Financial Emergency final and
                  conclusive and not questionable in any court on any ground.
                  But this provision was subsequently deleted by the 44th
