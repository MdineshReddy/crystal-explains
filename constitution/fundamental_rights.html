                  <b> Constitution of USA</b> (called Bill of Rights).
                </li>
                <li>
                  These are called <b>fundamental</b> because while ordinary
                  rights may be changed by the legislature in its ordinary
                  process of legislation, a Fundamental Right cannot be altered
                  by any process shorter than that required for amending the
                  Constitution itself.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Nor can they be suspended or abridged
                  <b
                    >except in the manner laid down in the Constitution
                    itself.</b
                  >

                <li>
                  They are <b>justiciable</b>, allowing persons to move the
                  courts for their enforcement, if and when they are violated.
                  They are defended and guaranteed by the Supreme Court. Hence,
                  the aggrieved person can directly go to the Supreme Court.

              <h3>Article 12: Definition of the State</h3>
              <p>Article defines the word 'state' comprising of:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Government and Parliament of India</li>

                </li>
                <li>
                  statutory or non-statutory authorities (LIC, ONGC, SAIL)
                </li>
                <li>
                  private body or an agency working as an instrument of the

                Article 13: Laws inconsistent with or in derogation of the
                fundamental rights
              </h3>
              <p>
                Article 13 declares that all laws that are inconsistent with or
                in derogation to any of the Fundamental Rights shall be void. In
                other words, it provides the scope for
                <b>doctrine of judicial review</b>. This power has been
                conferred on the Supreme Court (<b>Article 32</b>) and the High
                Courts (<b>Article 226</b>) that can declare a law
                unconstitutional and invalid on the ground of contravention of
                any of the Fundamental Rights.
              </p>
              <p>The term <b>‘law’</b> in Article 13 includes the following:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Permanent laws enacted by the Parliament or the State
                  Legislatures.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Temporary laws like ordinances issued by the President or the
                  State Governors.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Executive laws like order, bye-law, rule, regulation or
                  notification and
                </li>
                <li>
                  Non-legislative sources of law, i.e, custom or usage having
                  the force of law.
                </li>
              </ul>
              Thus, not only a legislation but any of the above can be
              challenged in the courts as violating a Fundamental Right and
              hence can be declared as void.

              <h2>Right to Equality (Articles 14 to 18)</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <h3>Article 14: Right to Equality</h3>
              <p>
                Article 14 confers on all individual, i.e. both the citizens and
                foreigners, (except enemy/aliens) the right to
                <b>equality before law</b> and
                <b>equal protection of the law.</b>
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Equality Before Law</b>: It means all individuals are equal
                in the eyes of law without any regard to the rank or position in
                society. It also means that all individuals are subjected to the
                ordinary law of land. The concept of equality before law is an
                element of the concept of <b>‘Rule of law’</b>- propounded by
                <b>AV Dicey</b>, the British Jurist
              </p>
              <div class="note">
                <p>
                  <b>Rule of Law</b> means the pre-dominance of legal spirit in
                  the administration of country and law should not be subjected
                  to the government but it should be the government that should
                  be subjected to law. It restricts the arbitrary exercise of
                  power by the Government by subordinating it to well-defined
                  and established laws.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The Supreme Court held that the <b>‘Rule of Law’</b> as
                  embodied in Article 14 is a <b>‘basic feature’</b> of the
                  constitution. Hence, it cannot be destroyed even by an
                  amendment.
                </p>
              </div>
              <p>
                <b>Equal Protection of the Law</b>: It recognises that all
                individuals should have equal opportunities to develop their
                talent. It does not mean the uniform application of law for all
                the people under all circumstances. It means equality of
                treatment in equal circumstances. Among equals, the law should
                be equal and equally administered, the
                <b
                  >like should be treated alike and different should not be
                  treated like.</b

              <h3>Exceptions to Equality</h3>
              <p>
                The rule of equality before law is not absolute and there are
                constitutional and other exceptions to it:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>

                  certain immunities (Article 361).

                <li>
                  Members of Parliament and State Legislatures shall not be
                  liable to any proceedings in any court in respect of anything
                  said or any vote given by them. (Articles 105 and 194).
                </li>
                <li>
                  The foreign sovereigns (rulers), ambassadors, diplomats, the
                  UNO and its agencies enjoy the diplomatic immunity
                </li>

                of religion, race, caste, sex and place of birth or area.
                Article 15 (2) is enforceable against
                <b>state as well as individuals</b>.

              <h3>Article 21: Protection of life and personal liberty.</h3>
              <p>
                It declares that no person shall be deprived of his life or
                personal liberty except according to
                <b>procedure established by law</b>. This right is available to
                <b>both citizens and non-citizens.</b>
              </p>

              <p>
                In the <b>Gopalan case</b> (1950), the Supreme Court held that
                the protection under Article 21 is available only against
                arbitrary executive action and not from arbitrary legislative
                action. This means that the State can deprive the right to life
                and personal liberty of a person based on a law. This is because
                of the expression
                <b>‘procedure established by law’</b>
                in Article 21, which is different from the expression
                <b>‘due process of law’</b>
                contained in the American Constitution.

                <p>
                  Procedure Established by Law says that a law that is duly
                  enacted by the legislature is valid if the procedure to
                  establish it has been correctly followed. It do not assess the
                  intent of the said law whether it is fair or not.
                </p>

                <p>
                  On the other hand, Due process of law checks whether the law
                  is fair and not arbitrary.

                However, in <b>Menaka case</b> (1978), the Supreme Court
                overruled its judgement in the Gopalan case by establishing that
                the right to life and personal liberty of a person can be
                deprived by a law provided the procedure prescribed by that law
                is <b>reasonable, fair and just</b>. In other words, it has

                Article 21A declares that the state shall provide
                <b>free and compulsory education</b> to all children of the age
                of <b>6 to 14 years</b> in such a manner as the state may
                determine. Thus, this provision makes only elementary education
                a Fundamental Right and not higher or professional education.

                Article 22 provides protection against arrest and detention in

                  no person, who has been arrested, shall be detained in custody

                <li>
                  He shall also not be denied the <b>right to consult</b> and to

                The Constitution however, permits the state to curb this rights
                under exceptional circumstances e.g. under the Preventive
                Detention Act, a person can be detained on the grounds of
                suspicion of committing anti-national activity.

                It is not available to an enemy alien and a person arrested or
                detained under a law providing for preventive detention
                (detention of a person without trial). The preventive detention
                of a person cannot exceed three months unless there is
                sufficient cause for extension.

                Article 23 prohibits trafficking in human beings and forced

                compulsory service for public purposes. But while imposing such
                service, the state can not make any discrimination on grounds of
                religion, race, caste, class or any of them. But it does not

                  This right has been described by Dr. Ambedkar as the

                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Writs- Types and their Scope</h3>
              <p>
                Under <b>Article 32</b>, Supreme Court and <b>Article 226</b>,
                High Court can issue writs of various forms in case of violation
                of Fundamental Rights. Further, the Parliament (under Article
                32) can empower any other court to issue these writs.
              </p>
              <p>
                The writ jurisdiction of the Supreme Court differs from that of
                a high court in three respects:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  The Supreme Court can issue writs only for the enforcement of
                  fundamental rights whereas a high court can issue writs not
                  only for the enforcement of Fundamental Rights but also for
                  the enforcement of an ordinary legal right. Thus, the writ
                  jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, in this respect, is
                  narrower than that of high court.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Supreme Court can issue writs against a person or
                  government throughout the territory of India whereas a high
                  court can issue writs against a person residing or against a
                  government or authority located within its territorial
                  jurisdiction. Thus, the territorial jurisdiction of the
                  Supreme Court for the purpose of issuing writs is wider than
                  that of a high court.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A remedy under Article 32 is in itself a Fundamental Right and
                  hence, the Supreme Court may not refuse to exercise its writ
                  jurisdiction. On the other hand, a remedy under Article 226 is
                  discretionary and hence, a high court may refuse to exercise
                  its writ jurisdiction. The Supreme Court is thus constituted
                  as a defender and guarantor of the fundamental rights.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <h2>Types of Writs</h2>
              <h3>Habeas Corpus</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  It is a Latin term meaning <b>‘to have the body of’</b>. It is
                  an order issued by the court to a person who has detained
                  another person, to produce the body of the latter before it.
                  The court then examines the cause and legality of detention.
                  It would set the detained person free, if the detention is
                  found to be illegal. Thus, this writ is a bulwark of
                  individual liberty against arbitrary detention.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The writ of habeas corpus can be issued against
                  <b> both public authorities as well as private individuals</b
                  >. The writ, on the other hand, is not issued where the (a)
                  detention is lawful, (b) the proceeding is for contempt of a
                  legislature or a court, (c) detention is by a competent court,
                  and (d) detention is outside the jurisdiction of the court.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Mandamus</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  It literally means <b>‘we command’</b>. It is a command issued
                  by the court to a public official asking him to perform his
                  official duties that he has failed or refused to perform. It
                  can also be issued against any public body, a corporation, an
                  inferior court, a tribunal or government for the same purpose.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The writ of mandamus cannot be issued (a) against a private
                  individual or body; (b) to enforce departmental instruction
                  that does not possess statutory force; (c) when the duty is
                  discretionary and not mandatory; (d) to enforce a contractual
                  obligation; (e) against the president of India or the state
                  governors; and (f) against the chief justice of a high court
                  acting in judicial capacity.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Quo Warranto</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  In the literal sense, it means
                  <b>‘by what authority or warrant’.</b> It is issued by the
                  court to enquire into the legality of claim of a person to a
                  public office. Hence, it prevents illegal usurpation of public
                  office by a person.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Unlike the other four writs, this can be sought by any
                  interested person and not necessarily by the aggrieved person.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Prohibition</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Literally, it means <b>‘to forbid’</b>. It is issued by a
                  higher court to a lower court or tribunal to prevent the
                  latter from exceeding its jurisdiction or usurping a
                  jurisdiction that it does not possess. Thus, unlike mandamus
                  that directs activity, the prohibition directs inactivity.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The writ of prohibition can be issued
                  <b>only against judicial and quasi-judicial authorities</b>.
                  It is not available against administrative authorities,
                  legislative bodies, and private individuals or bodies.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Certiorari</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  In the literal sense, it means
                  <b>‘to be certified’ or ‘to be informed’</b>. It is issued by
                  a higher court to a lower court or tribunal either to transfer
                  a case pending with the latter to itself or to squash the
                  order of the latter in a case. It is issued on the grounds of
                  excess of jurisdiction or lack of jurisdiction or error of
                  law. Thus, unlike prohibition, which is only preventive,
                  certiorari is both preventive as well as curative.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Previously, the writ of certiorari could be issued only
                  against judicial and quasi-judicial authorities and not
                  against administrative authorities. However, in 1991, the
                  Supreme Court ruled that the certiorari can be issued even
                  against administrative authorities affecting rights of
                  individuals.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Like prohibition, certiorari is also not available against
                  legislative bodies and private individuals or bodies.

                  as to ensure proper discharge of their duties and maintenance
                  of discipline among them.

                  throughout India with regard to the nature of those
                  fundamental rights and punishment for their infringement.
                </li>

              <h3>Suspension of Fundamental Rights</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The Fundamental Rights guaranteed under the Indian
                  Constitution can be suspended by the President during
                  <b>emergency</b> arising out of threat to the security of
                  India or any part of its territory or due to actual external
                  aggression.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It may be noted that the President has to issue specific order
                  for the suspension of the Fundamental Rights and such orders
                  must be placed before the Parliament at the earliest possible.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The President of India can also suspend the right to move to
                  the court for the enforcement of these Fundamental Rights
                  <b>except the rights available under Articles 20 and 21</b>.
                  When such orders have been issued, the state has the authority
                  to make any law or take any executive action with regard to
                  the Fundamental Rights.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It may be noted that in other democratic countries like USA,
                  the Fundamental Rights of the citizens can not be suspended
                  even during emergency.

                <p>
                  Of all the fundamental rights only five rights are exclusive
                  to Indian Citizens. The remaining are available to both
                  citizens and foreigners (except enemy aliens). These five

              <h3>Rights Outside of Part III</h3>
              <p>
                Besides the Fundamental Rights included in Part III, there are
                certain other rights contained in other parts of the
                Constitution. These rights are known as
                <b
                  >constitutional rights or legal rights or non-fundamental
                  rights</b
                >. They are:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  No tax shall be levied or collected except by authority of law
                  (Article 265 in Part XII).
                </li>
                <li>
                  No person shall be deprived of his property save by authority
                  of law (Article 300-A in Part XII).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Trade, commerce and intercourse throughout the territory of
                  India shall be free (Article 301 in Part XIII).
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Even though the above rights are also equally justiciable, they
                are different from the Fundamental Rights. In case of violation
                of a Fundamental Right, the aggrieved person can directly move
                the Supreme Court for its enforcement under Article 32, which is
                in itself a fundamental right. But, in case of violation of the
                above rights, the aggrieved person cannot avail this
                constitutional remedy. He can move the High Court by an ordinary
                suit or under Article 226 (writ jurisdiction of high court) .
