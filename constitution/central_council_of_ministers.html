              <p>
                In the parliamentary form of government provided by the
                constitution, the council of ministers headed by the prime
                minister is the real executive authority.
              </p>
              <p>
                The provisions related to the Prime Minister and the Union
                Council of Ministers are broadly described in two Articles i.e.,
                74 and 75.
              </p>

                Before a minister enters upon his office, the president
                administers to him the oaths of office and secrecy.

              <p>
                "I, (name), do swear in the name of God (or solemnly affirm)
                that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution
                of India as by law established, that I will uphold the
                sovereignty and integrity of India, that I will faithfully and

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Collective Responsibility:</b> Article 75 clearly states
                  that the council of ministers is collectively responsible to
                  the Lok Sabha.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Individual Responsibility:</b> Article 75 also contains the

                  ministers hold office during the pleasure of the president,
                  which means that the President can remove a minister even at a
                  time when the council of ministers enjoys the confidence of
                  the Lok Sabha. However, the President removes a minister only
                  on the advice of the Prime Minister.

                  Constitution for the system of legal responsibility of a
                  minister. It is not required that an order of the President
                  for a public act should be countersigned by a minister.
                  Moreover, the courts are barred from enquiring into the nature
                  of advice rendered by the ministers to the president

              </ul>
              <h2>Composition of the Council of Ministers</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                The council of ministers consists of three categories of
                ministers:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Cabinet Ministers</li>
                <li>Ministers of State</li>
                <li>Deputy ministers</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                At the top of all these ministers stands the Prime Minister as
                the supreme governing authority of the country.
              </p>
              <h3>Cabinet Ministers</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The cabinet ministers head the important ministries of the
                  Central government like home, defence, finance, external
                  affairs and so forth.

                  They are members of the cabinet, attend its meetings and play
                  an important role in deciding policies.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Ministers of State</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The ministers of state are the head of one or more departments
                  in a ministry.

                  states department, internal security department, border

                  There may be some portfolios or ministries that Prime Minister
                  may not give to any cabinet ministers. If the departments of
                  these ministries are individually handled by minister without
                  cabinet minister then he is
                  <b>Ministers of State with Independent Charge</b> . They
                  report directly to Prime Minister.
                </li>

                  related to their ministries/ departments are considered by the
                  cabinet.
                </li>
              </ul>

                  They are not given independent charge of
                  ministries/departments.
