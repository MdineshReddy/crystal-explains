                (de jure executive) and Prime Minister is the
                <b>real executive authority</b> (de facto executive). In other
                words, president is the head of the State while Prime Minister
                is the head of the government.

              <h2>Appointment of the Prime-Minister</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                The Constitution does not contain any specific procedure for the
                selection and appointment of the Prime Minister.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Article 75</b> says only that the Prime Minister shall be
                appointed by the president. However, this does not imply that
                the president is free to appoint any one as the Prime Minister.
                The following conventions have evolved over the years for
                appointing the Prime Minister:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  the President has to appoint the leader of the majority party
                  in the Lok Sabha as the Prime Minister. But, when no party has
                  a clear majority in the Lok Sabha, then the President may
                  exercise his personal discretion and usually appoints the
                  leader of the largest party or coalition in the Lok Sabha as
                  the Prime Minister and asks him to seek a vote of confidence
                  in the House within a month.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When the Prime Minister in office dies suddenly and there is
                  no obvious successor, the president may have to exercise his
                  individual judgement in the selection and appointment of the
                  Prime Minister. However, if, on the death of an incumbent
                  Prime Minister, the ruling party elects a new leader, the
                  President has no choice but to appoint him as Prime Minister.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In 1980, the Delhi High Court held that the Constitution does
                  not require that a person must prove his majority in the Lok
                  Sabha before he is appointed as the Prime Minister. The
                  President may first appoint him the Prime Minister and then
                  ask him to prove his majority in the Lok Sabha within a
                  reasonable period.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In 1997, the Supreme Court held that a person who is not a
                  member of either House of Parliament can be appointed as Prime
                  Minister for six months, within which, he should become a
                  member of either House of Parliament; otherwise, he ceases to
                  be the Prime Minister.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h2>Oath and Term of the Prime Minister</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <h3>Oath</h3>
              <p>
                Before the Prime Minister enters upon his office, the president
                administers to him the oaths of office and secrecy.
              </p>
              <p><b>In his oath of office, the Prime Minister swears:</b></p>
              <p>
                "I, (name), do swear in the name of God (or solemnly affirm)
                that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution
                of India as by law established, that I will uphold the
                sovereignty and integrity of India, that I will faithfully and
                conscientiously discharge my duties as Prime Minister for the
                Union and that I will do right to all manner of people in
                accordance with the Constitution and the law, without fear or
                favour, affection or ill-will."
              </p>
              <p><b>In his oath of secrecy, the Prime Minister swears:</b></p>
              <p>
                " I, (name), do swear in the name of God (or solemnly affirm)
                that I will not directly or indirectly communicate or reveal to
                any person or persons any matter which shall be brought under my
                consideration or shall become known to me as Prime Minister for
                the Union except as may be required for the due discharge of my
                duties as such Minister."
              </p>
              <h3>Term</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The term of the Prime Minister is not fixed and he holds
                  office during the pleasure of the president.
                </li>
                <li>
                  However, this does not mean that the president can dismiss the
                  Prime Minister at any time. As long as the Prime Minister
                  enjoys the majority support in the Lok Sabha, he cannot be
                  dismissed by the President.
                </li>
                <li>
                  However, if he loses the confidence (i.e., fails No-Confidence
                  Motion) of the Lok Sabha, he must resign or the President can
                  dismiss him.
                </li>
              </ul>
