                constitution, the President has been made only a nominal
                executive, the real executive being the Council of Ministers
                headed by the Prime Minister. All of the powers vested in the
                president are, in practice, exercised by the prime minister with
                the help of the Council of Ministers. The president is bound by
                the constitution to act on the advice of the prime minister and
                cabinet as long as the advice is not violating the constitution.

              <h3>Procedure</h3>
              <p>
                Each elector is given only one ballot paper. The voter is
                required to indicate his preferences by marking 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.
                against the names of candidates. This means that the voter can
                indicate as many preferences as there are candidates in the
                fray.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the first phase, the first preference votes are counted. In
                case a candidate secures the required quota in this phase, he is
                declared elected. Otherwise, the process of
                <b>transfer of votes</b> is set in motion. The ballots of the
                candidate securing the least number of first preference votes
                are cancelled and his second preference votes are transferred to
                the first preference votes of other candidates. This process
                continues till a candidate secures the required quota.
              </p>

              <p>
                Under Article 71, all disputes regarding election of the
                President are inquired into and decided by the Supreme Court
                whose decision is final.

              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                Before entering upon his office, the President has to make and
                subscribe to an oath or affirmation. In his oath, the President
                swears:
              </p>
              <p>
                "I, (name), do swear in the name of God (or solemnly affirm)

                discharge the functions of the President) of the Republic of
                India, and will to the best of my ability preserve, protect and
                defend the Constitution and the law, and that I will devote

                Republic of India."
              </p>
              <p>
                The oath of office to the President is administered by the

              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                Under Article 62 a vacancy in the President’s office can occur
                in any of the following ways:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>On the expiry of his tenure of 5 years.</li>
                <li>By his resignation. (by writing to the Vice President)</li>
                <li>By his death.</li>
                <li>Removal by supreme court.</li>
                <li>Removal by Impeachment.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                When the vacancy is going to be caused by the expiration of the
                term of the sitting President, an election to fill the vacancy
                must be held before the expiration of the term.
              </p>
              <p>
                If the office falls vacant by resignation, removal, death or
                otherwise, then election to fill the vacancy should be held
                <b>within six months</b> from the date of the occurrence of such
                a vacancy. The newly-elected President remains in office for a
                full term of five years from the date he assumes charge of his
                office.
              </p>
              <p>
                When a vacancy occurs in the office of the President due to his
                resignation, removal, death or when the sitting President is
                unable to discharge his functions due to absence, illness or any
                other cause, the
                <b>Vice-President</b> acts as the President until a new
                President is elected or until the President resumes his office
                (article 65). In case the office of Vice-President is also
                vacant, the <b>Chief Justice of India</b> (or if his office is
                also vacant, the
                <b>seniormost judge of the Supreme Court</b> available) acts as
                the President or discharges the functions of the President.
              </p>
              <p>
                When any person, ie, Vice-President, chief justice of India, or
                the seniormost judge of the Supreme Court is acting as the
                President or discharging the functions of the President, he
                enjoys all the powers and immunities of the President and is
                entitled to such emoluments, allowances and privileges as are
                determined by the Parliament.

                  His prior recommendation or permission is needed to introduce
                  certain types of bills in the Parliament. For example, a bill
                  involving expenditure from the Consolidated Fund of India
                  (Money Bill), or a bill for the alteration of boundaries of

                  However, if the bill is passed again by the Parliament, with
                  or without amendments, the President has to give his assent to
                  the bill.
                </p>

                <li>
                  When a bill passed by a state legislature is reserved by the
                  governor for consideration of the President, the President
                  can:
                </li>

                  <li>give his assent to the bill, or</li>
                  <li>withhold his assent to the bill, or</li>
                  <li>
                    direct the governor to return the bill (if it is not a money
                    bill) reconsideration of the state legislature.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  It should be noted that it is not obligatory for the President
                  to give his assent even if the bill is again passed by the
                  state legislature and sent again to him for his consideration.
                </p>

                <li>
                  He lays the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General,
                  Union Public Service Commission, Finance Commission, and
                  others, before the Parliament.
                </li>

                  Under <b>Article 123</b>, he can promulgate ordinances on

                  <b>subjects on which the Parliament can make laws</b> (i.e.,
                  union and concurrent lists), when
                  <b> either or both</b> houses of Parliament are not in session
                  (on the
                  <b

                    minister</b

                  ). These ordinances must be approved by the Parliament
                  <b>within six weeks</b> from its reassembly. He can also
                  withdraw an ordinance at any time.

                  was deleted by the 44th Constitutional Amendment Act of 1978.
                  Thus, the President’s satisfaction is justiciable on the
                  ground of malafide.

              </ul>
              <h3>Military Powers</h3>

                <li>
                  He can declare war or conclude peace, subject to the approval
                  of the Parliament.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Emergency Powers</h3>
              <p>
                In addition to the normal powers mentioned above, the
                Constitution confers extraordinary powers on the President to
                deal with the following three types of emergencies:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>National Emergency (Article 352)</li>
                <li>President’s Rule (Article 356 & 365)</li>
                <li>Financial Emergency (Article 360)</li>
              </ol>
              <h2>Veto Powers of the President</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>There are four types of Veto:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <b>Absolute veto</b>, that is, withholding of assent to the
                  bill passed by the legislature.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Qualified veto</b>, which can be overridden by the
                  legislature with a higher majority.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b> Suspensive veto</b>, which can be overridden by the
                  legislature with an ordinary majority.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Pocket veto</b> , that is, taking no action on the bill
                  passed by the legislature.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                Of the above four, the President of India is vested with three–
                absolute veto, suspensive veto and pocket veto. There is no
                qualified veto in the case of Indian President.
              </p>
              <h3>Closer Look at three veto powers of the President</h3>
              <h3>Absolute Veto</h3>
              <p>
                The power of the President to withhold the assent to the bill is
                termed as his absolute veto. When the President exercises his
                absolute veto, a bill will never see the light of day.
              </p>
              <p>
                President uses his absolute veto in the following two cases:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  When the bill passed by the Parliament is a Private Member
                  Bill (i.e., bills introduced by any member of Parliament who
                  is not a minister).
                </li>
                <li>
                  When the cabinet resigns before President could give his
                  assent to the bill. The new cabinet may advise the President
                  to not give his assent to the bill passed by the old cabinet.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Suspensive Veto</h3>
              <p>
                The President exercises this veto when he returns a bill for
                reconsideration of the Parliament. However, if the bill is
                passed again by the Parliament with or without amendments and
                again presented to the President, it is obligatory for the
                President to give his assent to the bill.
              </p>
              <p>
                The President does not possess this veto in the case of money
                bills. The President can either give his assent to a money bill
                or withhold his assent to a money bill but cannot return it for
                the reconsideration of the Parliament. Normally, the President
                gives his assent to money bill as it is introduced in the
                Parliament with his previous permission.
              </p>
              <h3>Pocket Veto</h3>
              <p>
                In this case, the President neither ratifies nor rejects nor
                returns the bill, but simply keeps the bill pending for an
                indefinite period.
              </p>
              <p>
                Constitution does not give any time-limit to President within
                which he has to act upon the bill.
              </p>
