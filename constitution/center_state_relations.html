                There are four aspects in the Centre-states legislative
                relations:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>Territorial extent of Central and state legislation</li>
                <li>Distribution of legislative subjects</li>
                <li>Parliamentary legislation in the state field and</li>
                <li>Centre’s control over state legislation</li>
              </ol>
              <h3>
                1. Territorial extent of Central and state legislation (Article
                245)
              </h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The Parliament can make laws for the whole or any part of the
                  territory of India.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A state legislature can make laws for the whole or any part of
                  the state.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Parliament alone can make ‘extraterritorial legislation’.
                  Thus, the laws of the Parliament are also applicable to the
                  Indian citizens and their property in any part of the world.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>2. Distribution of Legislative Subjects (Article 246)</h3>
              <p>
                The Constitution provides for a three-fold distribution of
                legislative subjects between the Centre and the states, viz.,
                List-I (the Union List), List-II (the State List) and List-III
                (the Concurrent List) in the Seventh Schedule:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The Parliament has exclusive powers to make laws with respect
                  to any of the matters enumerated in the Union List (98
                  subjects).
                </li>
                <li>
                  The state legislature has “in normal circumstances” exclusive
                  powers to make laws with respect to any of the matters
                  enumerated in the State List (59 subjects).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Both, the Parliament and state legislature can make laws with
                  respect to any of the matters enumerated in the Concurrent
                  List (52 subjects).
                </li>

                <li>
                  Parliament has power to make laws with respect to any matter
                  for the Union Territories or the Acquired Territories (if
                  any).
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Residuary powers of legislation:</b> The power to make laws
                  with respect to residuary subjects (i.e., the matters which
                  are not enumerated in any of the three lists) is vested in the
                  Parliament.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>3. Parliamentary Legislation in the State Field</h3>
              <p>
                The above scheme of distribution of legislative powers between
                the Centre and the states is to be maintained in normal times.
                But, in abnormal times, the Constitution empowers the Parliament
                to make laws on any matter enumerated in the State List under
                the following five extraordinary circumstances:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <b
                    >Power of Parliament to legislate with respect to a matter
                    in the State List in the national interest. (Article 249)
                  </b>
                </li>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    If the Rajya Sabha declares that it is necessary in the
                    national interest that Parliament should make laws with
                    respect to a matter in the State List, then the Parliament
                    becomes competent to make laws on that matter.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Such a resolution must be supported by two-thirds of the
                    members present and voting.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The resolution remains in force for one year; it can be
                    renewed any number of times but not exceeding one year at a
                    time.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The laws cease to have effect on the expiration of six
                    months after the resolution has ceased to be in force.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    This provision does not restrict the power of a state
                    legislature to make laws on the same matter. But, in case of
                    inconsistency between a state law and a parliamentary law,
                    the latter is to prevail.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    The laws become inoperative on the expiration of six months

                    Here also, the power of a state legislature to make laws on

                    repugnancy between a state law and a parliamentary law, the

                    requesting the Parliament to enact laws on a matter in the
                    State List, then the Parliament can make laws for regulating
                    that matter.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    A law so enacted applies only to those states which have
                    passed the resolutions. However, any other state may adopt
                    it afterwards by passing a resolution to that effect in its
                    legislature.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Such a law can be amended or repealed only by the Parliament
                    and not by the legislatures of the concerned states.

                  <li>
                    The resolution operates as abdication or surrender of the
                    power of the state legislature with respect to that matter
                    and it is placed entirely in the hands of Parliament which

                  for implementing the international treaties, agreements or
                  conventions. This provision enables the Central government to

                    A law made so by the Parliament continues to be operative

              <p>
                Besides the Parliament’s power to legislate directly on the
                state subjects under the exceptional situations, the
                Constitution empowers the Centre to exercise control over the
                state’s legislative matters in the following ways:

              <ol>

                  The governor can reserve certain types of bills passed by the
                  state legislature for the consideration of the President. The
                  president enjoys absolute veto over them.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Bills on certain matters enumerated in the State List can be
                  introduced in the state legislature only with the previous
                  sanction of the president. (For example, the bills imposing
                  restrictions on the freedom of trade and commerce).
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Centre can direct the states to reserve money bills and
                  other financial bills passed by the state legislature for the
                  President’s consideration during a financial emergency.

              <h3>Obligation of States and the Union</h3>
              <p>
                The Constitution has placed two restrictions on the executive
                power of the states in order to give ample scope to the Centre
                for exercising its executive power in an unrestricted manner.
                Thus, the executive power of every state is to be exercised in
                such a way:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  as to ensure compliance with the laws made by the Parliament
                  and any existing law which apply in the state; and
                </li>
                <li>
                  as not to impede or prejudice the exercise of executive power
                  of the Centre in the state.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                While the former lays down a general obligation upon the state,
                the latter imposes a specific obligation on the state not to
                hamper the executive power of the Centre
              </p>
              <p>
                In both the cases, the executive power of the Centre extends to
                giving of such directions to the state as are necessary for the
                purpose. The sanction behind these directions of the Centre is
                <b> coercive in nature</b>. Thus, Article 365 says that where
                any state has failed to comply with (or to give effect to) any
                directions given by the Centre, it will be lawful for the
                President to hold that a situation has arisen in which the
                government of the state cannot be carried on in accordance with
                the provisions of the Constitution. It means that, in such a
                situation, the <b>President’s rule</b> can be imposed in the
                state under Article 356.
              </p>
              <h3>Centre’s Directions to the States</h3>
              <p>
                In addition to the above two cases, the Centre is empowered to
                give directions to the states with regard to the exercise of
                their executive power in the following matters:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  the construction and maintenance of means of communication
                  (declared to be of national or military importance) by the
                  state;
                </li>
                <li>
                  the measures to be taken for the protection of the railways
                  within the state;
                </li>
                <li>
                  the provision of adequate facilities for instruction in the
                  mother tongue at the primary stage of education to children
                  belonging to linguistic minority groups in the state; and
                </li>
                <li>
                  the drawing up and execution of the specified schemes for the
                  welfare of the Scheduled Tribes in the state.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The coercive sanction behind the Central directions under
                Article 365 (mentioned above) is also applicable in these cases.
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  The President may, with the consent of the state government,
                  entrust to that government any of the executive functions of
                  the Centre.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Conversely, the governor of a state may, with the consent of
                  the Central government, entrust to that government any of the
                  executive functions of the state.
                </li>
                <li>
                  This mutual delegation of administrative functions may be
                  conditional or unconditional.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Constitution also makes a provision for the entrustment of
                  the executive functions of the Centre to a state without the
                  consent of that state. But, in this case, the delegation is by
                  the Parliament and not by the president. Thus, a law made by
                  the Parliament on a subject of the Union List can confer
                  powers and impose duties on a state, or authorize the
                  conferring of powers and imposition of duties by the Centre
                  upon a state (irrespective of the consent of the state
                  concerned). Notably, the same thing cannot be done by the
                  state legislature.

              <p>
                Besides sharing of taxes between the Centre and the states, the
                Constitution provides for grants-in-aid to the states from the
                Central resources. There are two types of grants-in-aid:
                statutory grants and discretionary grants.
              </p>
              <h4>Statutory Grants</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Article 275 empowers the Parliament to make grants to the
                  states which are in need of financial assistance and not to
                  every state. These grants are charged on the Consolidated Fund
                  of India every year.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Apart from this general provision, the Constitution also
                  provides for specific grants for promoting the welfare of the
                  scheduled tribes in a state or for raising the level of
                  administration of the scheduled areas in a state including the
                  State of Assam
                </li>
                <li>
                  The statutory grants under Article 275 (both general and
                  specific) are given to the states on the recommendation of the
                  Finance Commission.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Discretionary Grants</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Article 282 empowers both the Centre and the states to make
                  any grants for any public purpose, even if it is not within
                  their respective legislative competence. Under this provision,
                  the Centre makes grants to the states.
                </li>
                <li>
                  These grants have a two-fold purpose: to help the state
                  financially to fulfil plan targets; and to give some leverage
                  to the Centre to influence and coordinate state action to
                  effectuate the national plan.

              <h3>Borrowing by the Centre and the States</h3>
              <p>
                The Constitution makes the following provisions with regard to
                the borrowing powers of the Centre and the states:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The Central government can borrow either within India or
                  outside upon the security of the Consolidated Fund of India or
                  can give guarantees, but both within the limits fixed by the
                  Parliament. So far, no such law has been enacted by the
                  Parliament.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Similarly, a state government can borrow within India (and not
                  abroad) upon the security of the Consolidated Fund of the
                  State or can give guarantees, but both within the limits fixed
                  by the legislature of that state.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Central government can make loans to any state or give
                  guarantees in respect of loans raised by any state. Any sums
                  required for the purpose of making such loans are to be
                  charged on the Consolidated Fund of India.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A state cannot raise any loan without the consent of the
                  Centre, if there is still outstanding any part of a loan made
                  to the state by the Centre or in respect of which a guarantee
                  has been given by the Centre.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Commissions on Center State Relations</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <h3>Rajamannar Committee</h3>
              <p>
                In 1969, the Tamil Nadu Government (DMK) appointed a three
                member committee under the chairmanship of Dr. P.V. Rajamannar
                to examine the entire question of Centre-state relations and to
                suggest amendments to the Constitution so as to secure utmost
                autonomy to the states. The committee submitted its report to
                the Tamil Nadu Government in 1971.
              </p>
              <p>
                The important recommendations of the committee are as follows:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>An Inter-State Council should be set up immediately</li>
                <li>Finance Commission should be made a permanent body</li>
                <li>
                  Planning Commission should be disbanded and its place should
                  be taken by a statutory body;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Articles 356, 357 and 365 (dealing with President’s Rule)
                  should be totally omitted;
                </li>
                <li>
                  The provision that the state ministry holds office during the
                  pleasure of the governor should be omitted
                </li>
                <li>
                  Certain subjects of the Union List and the Concurrent List
                  should be transferred to the State List
                </li>
                <li>
                  the residuary powers should be allocated to the states; and
                </li>
                <li>
                  All-India services (IAS, IPS and IFS) should be abolished.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The Central government completely ignored the recommendations of
                the Rajamannar Committee.
              </p>
              <h3>Sarkaria Commission</h3>
              <p>
                In 1983, the Central government appointed a three-member
                Commission on Centre state relations under the chairmanship of
                R.S. Sarkaria, a retired judge of the Supreme Court. The
                Commission made 247 recommendations to improve Centre state
                relations. The important recommendations are mentioned below:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  A permanent Inter-State Council called the Inter-Governmental
                  Council should be set up under Article 263.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Article 356 (President’s Rule) should be used very sparingly,
                  in extreme cases as a last resort when all the available
                  alternatives fail.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The institution of All-India Services should be further
                  strengthened and some more such services should be created.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When the president withholds his assent to the state bills,
                  the reasons should be communicated to the state government.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The zonal councils should be constituted afresh and
                  reactivated to promote the spirit of federalism.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Centre should have powers to deploy its armed forces, even
                  without the consent of states. However, it is desirable that
                  the states should be consulted.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Centre should consult the states before making a law on a
                  subject of the Concurrent List.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The procedure of consulting the chief minister in the
                  appointment of the state governor should be prescribed in the
                  Constitution itself.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The governor cannot dismiss the council of ministers so long
                  as it commands a majority in the assembly.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The governor’s term of five years in a state should not be
                  disturbed except for some extremely compelling reasons.
                </li>
                <li>
                  No commission of enquiry should be set up against a state
                  minister unless a demand is made by the Parliament.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The present division of functions between the Finance
                  Commission and the Planning Commission is reasonable and
                  should continue.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Steps should be taken to uniformly implement the
                  three-language formula in its true spirit.
                </li>
                <li>
                  No autonomy for radio and television but decentralization in
                  their operations.
                </li>
                <li>
                  No change in the role of Rajya Sabha and Centre’s power to
                  reorganize the states.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The commissioner for linguistic minorities should be
                  activated.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The Central government has implemented 180 (out of 247)
                recommendations of the Sarkaria Commission. The most important
                is the establishment of the Inter-State Council in 1990.
              </p>
              <h3>Punchhi Commission</h3>
              <p>
                The Second commission on Centre-State Relations was set-up by
                the Government of India in April 2007 under the Chairmanship of
                Madan Mohan Punchhi, former Chief Justice of India. Some of its
                important recommendations are given in the following:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  It called for giving a fixed term of five years to the
                  governors and their removal by the process of impeachment
                  (similar to that of the President) by the State Legislature.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The governor should have the right to sanction the prosecution
                  of a minister against the advice of the council of ministers.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It called for an amendment of Articles 355 and 356 to enable
                  the center to bring specific trouble-torn areas under its rule
                  for a limited period. Hence, it proposed ‘localizing emergency
                  provisions’ under which either a district or parts of a
                  district can be brought under the central rule instead of the
                  whole state. Such an emergency should not be for more than 3
                  months.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It proposed that the Centre should have the power to deploy
                  its forces in case of communal conflagration without the
                  state’s consent for a short period of a week.
                </li>
