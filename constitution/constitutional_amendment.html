                Constitution is a dynamic document; it evolves from time-to-time
                to reflect the aspiration of the people. This process of
                modifying the constitution is called an Amendment.

                <b>Article 368</b> of the Indian Constitution deals with the
                powers of the Parliament to amend the Constitution and its
                procedures. However, the Parliament cannot amend those
                provisions which form the
                <b> ‘basic structure’</b>
                of the Constitution. This was ruled by the Supreme Court in the
                <b> Kesavananda Bharati case</b> (1973).
              </p>
              <p>
                The procedure laid down for its amendment is neither as easy as
                in Britain nor as difficult as in USA. In other words, the
                Indian Constitution is neither flexible nor rigid but a
                synthesis of both.
              </p>
              <h3>Procedure for Amendment</h3>
              <p>
                The procedure for the amendment of the Constitution as laid down
                in Article 368 is as follows:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  An amendment of the Constitution can be initiated only by the
                  introduction of a bill for the purpose in either House of
                  Parliament and not in the state legislatures.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The bill can be introduced either by a minister or by a
                  private member and does not require prior permission of the
                  president.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The bill must be passed in each House by a special majority,
                  that is, a majority of the total membership of the House and a
                  majority of two-thirds of the members of the House present and
                  voting.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Each House must pass the bill separately. In case of a
                  disagreement between the two Houses, there is no provision for
                  holding a joint sitting of the two Houses for the purpose of
                  deliberation and passage of the bill.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If the bill seeks to amend the federal provisions of the
                  Constitution, it must also be ratified by the legislatures of
                  half of the states by a simple majority, that is, a majority
                  of the members of the House present and voting.
                </li>
                <li>
                  After duly passed by both the Houses of Parliament and
                  ratified by the state legislatures, where necessary, the bill
                  is presented to the president for assent.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The president must give his assent to the bill. He can neither
                  withhold his assent to the bill nor return the bill for
                  reconsideration of the Parliament.
                </li>
                <li>
                  After the president’s assent, the bill becomes an Act (i.e., a
                  constitutional amendment act) and the Constitution stands
                  amended in accordance with the terms of the Act.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Types of Amendments</h3>
              <p>Article 368 provides for two types of amendments, that is:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>by Special majority of Parliament</li>
                <li>
                  by Special Majority of Parliament and ratification by half of
                  states.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                But some other articles provide for the amendment of certain
                provisions of the Constitution by a simple majority of
                Parliament, that is, a majority of the members of each House
                present and voting (similar to the ordinary legislative
                process). Notably, these amendments are not deemed to be
                amendments of the Constitution for the purposes of Article 368.

              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                'Basic Structure' is a limitation imposed on the amending power
                of the Parliament of India. The word "Basic Structure" is not
                mentioned in the constitution of India. The concept developed
                gradually with the interference of the judiciary from time to
                time to protect the basic rights of the people and the ideals
                and the philosophy of the constitution. Hence it is a
                <b> Judicial Innovation</b>.
              </p>
              <h2>Evolution of 'Basic Structure'</h2>
              <h3>Shankari Prasad vs. Union of India case</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The <b>First Constitution Amendment Act, 1951</b> curtailed

                </li>
                <li>
                  This amendment was challenged in the
                  <b>Shankari Prasad vs. Union of India case</b> on the ground
                  that it violates the Part-III of the constitution and

                  fundamental rights.

                  Court overruled its earlier decision.
                </li>
                <li>
                  This case challenged the constitutional validity of the
                  Seventeenth Amendment Act (1964), which inserted certain state
                  acts in the Ninth Schedule (the Ninth Schedule contains a list
                  of central and state laws which cannot be challenged in
                  courts).
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Supreme Court Reponse: </b> The Supreme Court held that the
                  Parliament has no power to amend Part III of the constitution
                  as the fundamental rights are transcendental and
                  <b>immutable</b>. According to the Supreme Court ruling,
                  Article 368 only lays down the procedure to amend the
                  constitution and does not give absolute powers to the
                  parliament to amend any part of the constitution. A

                  the <b>24th Amendment Act (1971)</b> . This Act amended
                  Articles 13 and 368. It declared that the Parliament has the
                  power to abridge or take away any of the Fundamental Rights
                  under Article 368 and such an act will not be a law under the

              <h3>Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala, (1973)</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The Supreme Court overruled its judgement in the Golak Nath
                  case (1967). It upheld the validity of the 24th Amendment Act
                  (1971) and stated that Parliament is empowered to abridge or
                  take away any of the Fundamental Rights.
                </li>
                <li>
                  At the same time, it laid down a new doctrine of the
                  <b> ‘basic structure’</b>
                  of the Constitution. It ruled that the constituent power of
                  Parliament under Article 368 does not enable it to alter the
                  ‘basic structure’ of the Constitution. This means that the
                  Parliament cannot abridge or take away a Fundamental Right
