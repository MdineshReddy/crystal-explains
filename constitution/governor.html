                The Constitution lays down only two qualifications for the
                appointment of a person as a governor. These are:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>He should be a citizen of India.</li>
                <li>He should have completed the age of 35 years.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                Additionally, two conventions have also developed in this regard
                over the years.
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  First, he should be an outsider, that is, he should not belong
                  to the state where he is appointed, so that he is free from
                  the local politics.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Second, while appointing the governor, the president is
                  required to consult the chief minister of the state concerned,
                  so that the smooth functioning of the constitutional machinery
                  in the state is ensured.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                However, both the conventions have been violated on multiple
                occassions.
              </p>
              <h3>Conditions of Office</h3>
              <p>
                The Constitution lays down the following conditions for the
                governor’s office:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  He should not be a member of either House of Parliament or a
                  House of the state legislature. If any such person is
                  appointed as governor, he is deemed to have vacated his seat
                  in that House on the date on which he enters upon his office
                  as the governor.
                </li>
                <li>He should not hold any other office of profit.</li>
                <li>
                  He is entitled without payment of rent to the use of his
                  official residence (the Raj Bhavan).
                </li>
                <li>
                  He is entitled to such emoluments, allowances and privileges
                  as may be determined by Parliament and cannot be diminished
                  during his term of office.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                Like the President, the governor is also entitled to a number of
                privileges and immunities. He enjoys personal immunity from
                legal liability for his official acts. During his term of
                office, he is immune from any criminal proceedings, even in
                respect of his personal acts. He cannot be arrested or
                imprisoned. However, after giving two month's notice, civil
                proceedings can be instituted against him during his term of
                office in respect of his personal acts.
              </p>
              <h3>Term of Office of Governor</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  A governor holds office for a term of five years from the date
                  on which he enters upon his office. However, this term of five
                  years is subject to the pleasure of the President. The Supreme
                  Court held that the pleasure of the President is not
                  justifiable.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Further, he can resign at any time by addressing a resignation
                  letter to the President.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Hence, The governor has no security of tenure and no fixed term
                of office. He may be removed by the President at any time. The
                President may transfer a Governor appointed to one state to
                another state for the rest of the term. Further, a Governor
                whose term has expired may be reappointed in the same state or
                any other state. A governor can hold office beyond his term of
                five years until his successor assumes charge.
              </p>
              <h3>Oath or affirmation by the governor</h3>
              <p>
                Before entering upon his office, the governor has to make and
                subscribe to an oath or affirmation. In his oath, the governor
                swears:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>to faithfully execute the office.</li>
                <li>
                  to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution and the law
                  and
                </li>
                <li>
                  to devote himself to the service and well-being of the people
                  of the state.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                The oath of office to the governor is administered by the chief
                justice of the concerned state high court and in his absence,
                the senior-most judge of that court available.
              </p>
              <h2>Powers and Functions of the Governor</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                A governor possesses executive, legislative, financial and
                judicial powers more or less analogous to the President of
                India. However, he has no diplomatic, military or emergency
                powers like the president.
              </p>

                <li>

                </li>
                <li>
                  He can seek any information relating to the administration of
                  the affairs of the state and proposals for legislation from
                  the chief minister. He can require the chief minister to
                  submit for the consideration of the council of ministers any
                  matter on which a decision has been taken by a minister but
                  which has not been considered by the council.
                </li>

                  He can recommend the imposition of constitutional emergency in
                  a state to the president. During the period of President’s
                  rule in a state, the governor enjoys extensive executive
                  powers as an agent of the President
                </li>
                <li>

                  also appoints the vice-chancellors of universities in the
                  state.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Legislative Powers</h3>
              <p>
                A governor is an integral part of the state legislature. In that
                capacity, he has the following legislative powers and functions:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  He can summon or prorogue the state legislature and dissolve

                  appoint any member of the state legislature council to preside
                  over its proceedings when the offices of both Chairman and

                </li>
                <li>
                  When a bill is sent to the governor after it is passed by
                  state legislature, he can:
                </li>
                <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">

                    bill is passed again by the state legislature with or

                  <li>
                    Reserve the bill for the consideration of the president. In
                    one case such reservation is obligatory, that is, where the
                    bill passed by the state legislature endangers the position
                    of the state high court. In addition, the governor can also
                    reserve the bill if it is of the following nature:
                  </li>
                  <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">

                  Houses of the state legislature are not in session or when
                  either of the two Houses of the state legislature is not in
                  session. These ordinances must be approved by the state
                  legislature within six weeks from its reassembly. He can also
                  withdraw an ordinance anytime. This is the most important
                  legislative power of the governor.

                    <b>Note:</b> He cannot pardon a death sentence. Even if a
                    state law prescribes for death sentence, the power to grant
                    pardon lies with the President and not the governor. But the
                    governor can suspend, remit or commute a death sentence.

              <h2>Veto Powers of Governor</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <h3>In case of Ordinary Bills</h3>
              <p>
                Every ordinary bill, after it is passed by the state legislature
                (unicameral or bicameral), is presented to the governor for his
                assent. He has four alternatives:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  He may give his assent to the bill; the bill then becomes an
                  act.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He may withhold his assent to the bill, the bill then ends and

                <li>
                  He may return the bill for reconsideration of the House or
                  Houses. If the bill is passed by the House or Houses again
                  with or without amendments and presented to the governor for
                  his assent, the governor must give his assent to the bill.
                  Thus, the governor enjoys only a ‘suspensive veto’.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He may reserve the bill for the consideration of the
                  President.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                In case, the governor reserves a bill for the consideration of
                the President, he will not have any further role in the
                enactment of the bill.
              </p>
              <p>
                When a state bill is reserved by the governor for the
                consideration of the President, the President has three
                alternatives:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  He may give his assent to the bill, the bill then becomes an
                  act. This means that the assent of the Governor is no longer
                  required.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He may withhold his assent to the bill, the bill then ends and
                  does not become an Act.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He may return the bill for reconsideration of the House or
                  Houses of the state legislature. When a bill is so returned,
                  the House or Houses have to reconsider it within six months.
                  If the bill is passed by the House or Houses again with or
                  without amendments and presented to the president for his
                  assent, the president is <b>not bound</b> to give his assent
                  to the bill. He may give his assent to such a bill or withhold
                  his assent. (in the case of the bill re-sent by the
                  Parliament, he must give assent).
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>In case of Money Bills</h3>
              <p>
                Every money bill, after it is passed by the state legislature
                (unicameral or bicameral), is presented to the governor for his
                assent. He has three alternatives:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  He may give his assent to the bill; the bill then becomes an
                  act.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He may withhold his assent to the bill, the bill then ends and
                  does not become an act.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He may reserve the bill for the consideration of the
                  president.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                Thus, the governor cannot return a money bill for the
                reconsideration of the state legislature. Normally, the governor
                gives his assent to a money bill as it is introduced in the
                state legislature with his previous permission.
              </p>
              <p>
                In case, the governor reserves a money bill for the
                consideration of the President, he will not have any further
                role in the enactment of the bill. The President has two
                alternatives:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  He may give his assent to the bill; the bill then becomes an
                  Act.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He may withhold his assent to the bill, the bill then ends and
                  does not become an act.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                Thus, the President cannot return a money bill for the
                reconsideration of the state legislature (as in the case of the
                Parliament).
