                  Currently (2021) it consists of a Preamble, about
                  <b>470 Articles</b> (divided into 25 Parts) and
                  <b>12 Schedules</b>. (originally i.e, in 1949, it had 395

                  The following factors contributed to the elephantine size of

                    The Geographical factors such as the vastness of the country
                    and its diversity.

              <h3>Inspired From Various Sources</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The Constitutions of various countries all over the world were
                  referred while drafting the Indian Constitution. The
                  Constitution makers picked up the best of the provisions from
                  different constitutions and molded them to suit the Indian
                  Scenario.

                <li>
                  In this context, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar proudly acclaimed that the
                  Constitution of India has been framed after ‘ransacking all
                  the known Constitutions of the World.

                    A <b>rigid Constitution</b> in which, a special procedure is
                    established for its amendment. Example: the American

                    A <b>flexible constitution</b>, that can be amended in the

                  The Constitution of India establishes a federal system of
                  Government. It contains all the usual features of a
                  federation:

                    5) Rigidity of Constitution 6) Independent judiciary 7)

                  vested and exercised by the Council of Ministers headed by the
                  Prime Minister.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The President and the Governor are merely constitutional
                  heads.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Parliamentary System of Government as in the Great Britain
                  has been adopted primarily because of the political experience
                  of the Indian people gathered from the british rule in India.

              <h3>Integrated and Independent Judiciary</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The Supreme Court stands at the top of the integrated judicial
                  system in our country. Below it, there are high courts at the
                  state level. Under a high court, there is a hierarchy of
                  subordinate courts, that is, district courts and other lower
                  courts. This single system of courts enforces both the central
                  laws as well as the state laws, unlike in USA, where the
                  federal laws are enforced by the federal judiciary and the
                  state laws are enforced by the state judiciary.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Our Constitution established an independent Judiciary,
                  absolutely free from the influence of the executive and
                  legislature. The Constitution has made various provisions to
                  ensure its independence–security of tenure of the judges,
                  fixed service conditions for the judges, all the expenses of
                  the Supreme Court charged on the Consolidated Fund of India,
                  prohibition on discussion on the conduct of judges in the
                  legislatures, ban on practice after retirement, power to
                  punish for its contempt vested in the Supreme Court,
                  separation of the judiciary from the executive, and so on.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>
                Balance Between Judicial Supremacy and Parliamentary Sovereignty
              </h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The Constitution of India is a refined blending of judicial
                  supremacy and parliamentary sovereignty.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The principle of <b>judicial supremacy</b> with that of the
                  American Supreme Court, which can invalidate any act of the
                  American Congress on the simple plea of its being contrary to
                  the spirit of the Constitution.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The British Constitution on the other hand embodies the
                  principle of
                  <b>parliamentary sovereignty</b>. The British Parliament can
                  pass, amend, repeal any type of legislation, good or bad,
                  natural or unnatural and the courts in England cannot declare
                  null and void any Act of Parliament on any ground whatsoever.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Indian Constitution attempts to strike a perfect balance
                  by avoiding Judicial Supremacy of the American type and
                  parliamentary sovereignty of the British type. The Supreme
                  Court have power of
                  <b>judicial review</b> and can stand in judgement over the
                  sovereign will of Parliament in ensuring justice for the
                  people. Parliament is absolutely supreme in the sphere of
                  legislation within the bounds of <b>basic structure</b> of the
                  constitution.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Three-tier Government</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Originally, the Indian Constitution, like any other federal
                  Constitution, provided for a dual polity and contained
                  provisions with regard to the organisation and powers of the
                  Centre and the states.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Later, the 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts (1992)
                  have added a third-tier of Government (i.e., local
                  government).
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Fundamental Rights</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Similar to the Constitution of the USA, the Constitution of
                  India also includes a separate chapter guaranteeing
                  Fundamental Rights to all the citizens. These rights are
                  <b>justiciable and inviolable.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  They are binding on the legislature as well as on the
                  executive. If any of the rights is violated, a citizen has the
                  right to seek the protection of the judiciary.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Any Act of the legislature or order of the executive can be
                  declared null and void if it violates any of the Fundamental
                  Rights guaranteed to the citizens by the Constitution.
                </li>
                <li>
                  However, the Fundamental Rights are not absolute and subject
                  to reasonable restrictions.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Directive Principles of State Policy</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Taken from the constitution of Ireland, Directive Principles
                  of State Policy are the ideals which the state shall strive to
                  achieve as far as possible.
                </li>
                <li>
                  These principles are <b>non-justiciable</b>. No legal action
                  can be taken against the state in courts of law if it fails to
                  follow or realise any of these principles. They do not confer
                  any constitutional rights upon citizens and these cannot be
                  enforced through courts of law as in case of Fundamental
                  Rights.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Yet, the Constitution itself declares that ‘these principles
                  are fundamental in the governance of the country and it shall
                  be the duty of the state to apply these principles in making
                  laws’. Hence, they impose a moral obligation on the state
                  authorities for their application.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Fundamental Duties</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The original constitution did not provide for the Fundamental
                  Duties of the citizens.
                </li>
                <li>
                  These were added during the operation of internal emergency
                  (1975–77) by the
                  <b>42nd Constitutional Amendment Act of 1976</b> on the
                  recommendation of the Swaran Singh Committee.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The fundamental duties serve as a reminder to citizens that
                  while enjoying their rights, they have also to be quite
                  conscious of duties they owe to their country, their society
                  and to their fellow citizens.
                </li>
                <li>
                  However, like the Directive Principles, the duties are also
                  <b>non-justiciable</b> in nature.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>A Secular State</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The Constitution of India establishes a Secular State. Hence,
                  it does not uphold any particular religion as the official
                  religion of the Indian State.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Indian concept of secularism is different from that the
                  western concept of secularism preaches a complete separation
                  between the religion (the church) and the state (the
                  politics), Indian Constitution embodies the 'positive' concept
                  of secularism, i.e., giving
                  <b
                    >equal respect to all religions or protecting all religions
                    equally.</b
                  >
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Universal Adult Franchise</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Every Indian citizen above 18 years has a right to vote in the
                  elections without any discrimination of caste, sex, religion
                  etc. The voting age was reduced to 18 years from 21 years in
                  1989 by the 61st Constitutional Amendment Act of 1988.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Single Citizenship</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  All the Indians irrespective of their state, enjoy a single
                  citizenship of India.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In countries like USA, each person is not only a citizen of
                  USA, but also a citizen of the particular state to which he
                  belongs. In both these capacities, they enjoy different rights
                  and owe different obligations.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The principle of single citizenship was provided for in the
                  Indian Constitution in order to foster strong bond of social
                  and political unity among the people of India who were divided
                  on account of race, ethnicity, languages and multiplicity of
                  religious and cultural background.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Independent Bodies</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The Indian Constitution stablishes certain independent bodies
                  that are envisaged to be the bulkworks of the democratic
                  system of Government in India. These are:
                </li>
                <ul style="list-style-type: square">
                  <li>
                    <b>Election Commission</b> to conduct free and fair
                    elections to the Parliament, the state legislatures, the
                    office of President of India and the office of
                    Vice-president of India.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Comptroller and Auditor-General</b> of India to audit the
                    accounts of the Central and state governments.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Union Public Service Commission</b> to conduct
                    examinations for recruitment to all-India services and
                    higher Central services and to advise the President on
                    disciplinary matters.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b> State Public Service Commission</b> in every state to
                    conduct examinations for recruitment to state services and
                    to advice the governor on disciplinary matters.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <li>
                  The Constitution ensures the independence of these bodies
                  through various provisions like security of tenure, fixed
                  service conditions, expenses being charged on the Consolidated
                  Fund of India, and so on.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Emergency Provisions</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The Indian Constitution contains elaborate emergency
                  provisions to enable the President to meet any extraordinary
                  situation effectively. The rationality behind the
                  incorporation of these provisions is to safeguard the
                  sovereignty, unity, integrity and security of the country, the
                  democratic political system and the Constitution.
                </li>

                  During emergency our federal system becmones unitary without
                  any amendment of the constitution.
