              <p>
                Similar to the Union pattern, the council of ministers headed by
                the chief minister is the real executive authority in the state.
              </p>

              <p>
                The provisions related to the Chief Minister and the State
                Council of Ministers are broadly described in two Articles i.e.,
                163 and 164.

              </h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  There shall be a Council of Ministers with the Chief Minister
                  as the head to aid and advise the Governor in the exercise of
                  his functions, except in so far as he is required to exercise
                  his functions in his discretion.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If any question arises whether a matter falls within the
                  Governor’s discretion or not, decision of the Governor shall
                  be final, and the validity of anything done by the Governor
                  shall not be called in question on the ground that he ought or
                  ought not to have acted in his discretion.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The advice tendered by Ministers to the Governor shall not be
                  inquired into in any court.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                The Governor is not required to act personally (except in case
                of governor's discretion) without the aid and advice of the
                council of ministers or against the aid and advice of the
                council of ministers.

                  the right to speak and take part in the proceedings of the

                  The chief minister is appointed by the governor. The other
                  ministers are appointed by the governor on the advice of the
                  chief minister. This means that the governor can appoint only
                  those persons as ministers who are recommended by the chief
                  minister.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Usually, the members of the state legislature, either the
                  legislative assembly or the legislative council, are appointed
                  as ministers.

                  A person who is not a member of either House of the state
                  legislature can also be appointed as a minister. But, within
                  six months, he must become a member (either by election or by
                  nomination) of either House of the state legislature,
                  otherwise, he ceases to be a minister.

              <p>
                Before a minister enters upon his office, the governor
                administers to him the oaths of office and secrecy.
              </p>
              <p><b> In his oath of office, a Minister swears:</b></p>
              <p>

                I will bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of
                India as by law established, that I will uphold the sovereignty
                and integrity of India, that I will faithfully and

                of and that I will do right to all manner of people in
                accordance with the Constitution and the law without fear or

              <h2>Responsibilities of Council of Ministers:</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Collective Responsibility:</b> Article 164 clearly states
                  that the council of ministers is collectively responsible to
                  the legislative assembly of the state.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b> Individual Responsibility:</b> Article 164 also contains
                  the principle of individual responsibility. It states that the
                  ministers hold office during the pleasure of the governor.
                  This means that the governor can remove a minister at a time
                  when the council of ministers enjoys the confidence of the
                  legislative assembly. But the governor can remove a minister
                  only on the advice of the chief minister
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>No Legal Responsibility:</b> As at the Centre, there is no
                  provision in the Constitution for the system of legal
                  responsibility of the minister in the states. It is not
                  required that an order of the governor for a public act should
                  be countersigned by a minister. Moreover, the courts are
                  barred from enquiring into the nature of advice rendered by
                  the ministers to the governor.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h2>Composition of Council of Ministers</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                Like at the Centre, in the states too, the council of ministers
                consists of three categories of ministers, namely, cabinet
                ministers, ministers of state, and deputy ministers. At the top
                of all these ministers stands the chief minister as the supreme
                governing authority in the state.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The <b>cabinet ministers</b> head the important departments of
                  the state government like home, education, finance,
                  agriculture and so forth. They are members of the cabinet,
                  attend its meetings and play an important role in deciding
                  policies.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The <b>ministers of state</b> can either be given independent
                  charge of departments or can be attached to cabinet ministers.
                  However, they are not members of the cabinet and do not attend
                  the cabinet meetings unless specially invited when something
                  related to their departments are considered by the cabinet.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Next in rank are the <b>deputy ministers</b>. They are not
                  given independent charge of departments. They are attached to
                  the cabinet ministers and assist them in their administrative,
                  political and parliamentary duties. They are not members of
                  the cabinet and do not attend cabinet meetings.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                At times, the council of ministers may also include a
                <b>deputy chief minister</b> . The deputy chief ministers are
                appointed mostly for local political reasons.
              </p>
              <h3>Cabinet Committees</h3>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                The cabinet works through various committees called cabinet
                committees. They are of two types– standing and ad hoc. The
                former is of a permanent nature while the latter are of a
                temporary nature. They are set up by the chief minister
                according to the exigencies of the time and requirements of the
                situation.
              </p>
