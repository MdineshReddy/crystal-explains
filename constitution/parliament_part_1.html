              <h3>First-Past-The-Post System</h3>
              <p>
                Though the Constitution has adopted the system of proportional
                representation in the case of Rajya Sabha, it has not preferred
                the same system in the case of Lok Sabha. Instead, it has
                adopted the system of
                <b> territorial representation</b> (First-past-the-post system)
                for the election of members to the Lok Sabha.
              </p>
              <p>
                Under territorial representation, every member of the
                legislature represents a geographical area known as a
                constituency. From each constituency, only one representative is
                elected.
              </p>

                  >First-Past-The-Post System vs Proportional Representation
                  System</b
                >
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  In First-Past-The-Post system (also known as Simple Majority
                  System), a candidate who secures majority of votes is declared
                  elected. The winning candidate does not have to get 50% of
                  total votes, he simply needs to get more votes than his
                  opponents. So, for example if a candidate gets 30% percent of
                  the total votes and won. It does not represent the remaining
                  70% of the voters.
                </li>
                <li>
                  On the other hand, in the system of Proportional
                  representation, the number of seats won by a party is
                  proportionate to the number of votes they received. This
                  system has many variants. The one used in India is the
                  <b> Single transferable vote</b> System. In this system, the
                  voters (i.e., electoral college), while voting, rank the
                  candidates in order of their preference. Initially, the first
                  preference votes are counted, and if no one emerges with a
                  majority (more than 50%), the candidate with least first
                  preference votes is removed from consideration and the second
                  choices of those who voted for him are taken into
                  consideration. This process continues till a winner emerges
                  with a majority.

                <li>
                  The Rajya Sabha is a continuing chamber, that is, it is a

                </li>
                <li>
                  The retiring members are eligible for re-election and

                </li>
                <li>
                  The Constitution has not fixed the term of office of members
                  of the Rajya Sabha and left it to the Parliament. Accordingly,
                  the Parliament in the
                  <b>Representation of the People Act (1951)</b> provided that
                  the term of office of a member of the Rajya Sabha shall be

                  Unlike the Rajya Sabha, the Lok Sabha is not a continuing
                  chamber. Its normal term is <b>five years</b> from the date of
                  its first meeting after the general elections, after which it
                  automatically dissolves.
                </li>
                <li>
                  However, the President is authorized to dissolve the Lok Sabha
                  at any time even before the completion of five years and this
                  cannot be challenged in a court of law.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Further, the term of the Lok Sabha can be extended during the
                  period of national emergency by a law of Parliament for one
                  year at a time for any length of time. However, this extension
                  cannot continue beyond a period of six months after the
                  emergency has ceased to operate.

                The question of disqualification under the Tenth Schedule is
                decided by the Chairman in the case of Rajya Sabha and Speaker

              <h3>Speaker</h3>
              <h4>1. Election and Tenure</h4>
              <p>
                The Speaker is generally elected in the first meeting of the Lok

              </p>
              <p>
                Usually, the Speaker remains in office during the life of the
                Lok Sabha. However, he has to vacate his office earlier in any
                of the following three cases:

                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                It should be noted here that, whenever the Lok Sabha is
                dissolved, the Speaker does not vacate his office and continues
                till the newly-elected Lok Sabha meets.

              <h3>Deputy Speaker of Lok Sabha</h3>
              <p>
                Like the Speaker, the Deputy Speaker is also elected by the Lok
                Sabha itself from amongst its members. By convention Deputy
                Speaker is offered to opposition party member. The deputy
                speaker is

                ranking legislative officer of the Lok Sabha.
              </p>
              <p>
                Like the Speaker, the Deputy Speaker remains in office usually
                during the life of the Lok Sabha. However, he may vacate his
                office earlier in any of the following three cases:
              </p>

                  resolution can be moved only after giving 14 day's advance
                  notice. Further, when a resolution for the removal of the
                  Deputy Speaker is under consideration of the House, he cannot
                  preside at the sitting of the House, though he may be present.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <h4>Role, Powers, Functions of Deputy Speaker</h4>
              <p>
                He act as the presiding officer in case of leave or absence
                caused by death or illness of the Speaker of the Lok Sabha. In
                both the cases, he assumes all the powers of the Speaker. He
                also presides over the joint sitting of both the Houses of
                Parliament, in case the Speaker is absent from such a sitting.
              </p>
              <p>
                When the Speaker presides over the House, the Deputy Speaker is
                like any other ordinary member of the House. He can speak in the
                House, participate in its proceedings and vote on any question
                before the House in the first instance.
              </p>
              <p>
                Like the Speaker, the Deputy Speaker,
                <b>while presiding</b> over the House, cannot vote in the first
                instance; he can only exercise a casting vote in the case of a
                tie.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Deputy Speaker has one special privilege, that is, whenever
                he is appointed as a member of a parliamentary committee, he
                automatically becomes its chairman.
              </p>
              <h3>Panel of Chairpersons of Lok Sabha</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Under the Rules of Lok Sabha, the Speaker nominates from
                  amongst the members a panel of
                  <b> not more than ten chairpersons</b>. Any of them can
                  preside over the House in the absence of the Speaker or the
                  Deputy Speaker. He has the same powers as the Speaker when so
                  presiding. When a member of the panel of chairpersons is also
                  not present, any other person as determined by House acts as
                  the Speaker.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Note:</b> A member of the panel of chairpersons cannot
                  preside over the House, when the office of the Speaker or the
                  Deputy Speaker is vacant. During such time, the Speaker’s
                  duties are to be performed by such member of the House as the
                  President may appoint for the purpose.

                    Sabha vacates his office immediately before the first
                    meeting of the newly-elected Lok Sabha. Therefore, the
                    President appoints a member of the Lok Sabha as the Speaker
                    Pro-Tem. Usually, the senior most member is selected for
                    this. The President himself administers oath to the Speaker
                    Pro-Tem. The Speaker Pro-Tem has all the powers of the

                  Any member of the House as the president may appoint, in case
                  both the positions of Chairman and Deputy Chairman are

              <h3>Chairman of Rajya Sabha</h3>
              <p>
                The
                <b> vice-president</b> of India is the ex-officio Chairman of
                the Rajya Sabha. During any period when the Vice-president acts
                as President or discharges the functions of the President, he
                does not perform the duties of the office of the Chairman of
                Rajya Sabha.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Chairman of the Rajya Sabha can be removed from his office
                only if he is removed from the office of the Vice -President. As
                a presiding officer, the powers and functions of the Chairman in
                the Rajya Sabha are similar to those of the Speaker in the Lok
                Sabha. However, the Speaker has two special powers which are not
                enjoyed by the Chairman:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  The Speaker decides whether a bill is a money bill or not and
                  his decision on this question is final.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Speaker presides over a joint sitting of two Houses of
                  Parliament.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                Unlike the Speaker (who is a member of the House), the Chairman
                is not a member of the House. But like the Speaker, the Chairman
                also cannot vote in the first instance. He too can cast a vote
                in the case of an equality of votes.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Vice-President cannot preside over a sitting of the Rajya
                Sabha as its Chairman when a resolution for his removal is under
                consideration. However, he can be present and speak in the House
                and can take part in its proceedings, without voting, even at
                such a time (while the Speaker can vote in the first instance
                when a resolution for his removal is under consideration of the
                Lok Sabha).
              </p>

              <h3>Deputy Chairman of Rajya Sabha</h3>
              <p>
                The Deputy Chairman is elected by the Rajya Sabha itself from
                amongst its members. The Deputy Chairman is
                <b>not subordinate to the Chairman</b> . He is directly
                responsible to the Rajya Sabha. The Deputy Chairman vacates his
                office in any of the following three cases:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>if he ceases to be a member of the Rajya Sabha;</li>
                <li>if he resigns by writing to the Chairman; and</li>
                <li>
                  if he is removed by a resolution passed by a majority of all
                  the then members (effective majority) of the Rajya Sabha. Such
                  a resolution can be moved only after giving 14 day's advance
                  notice.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The Deputy Chairman performs the duties of the Chairman’s office
                when it is vacant or when the Vice-President acts as President
                or discharges the functions of the President. He also acts as
                the Chairman when the latter is a bsent from the sitting of the
                House. In both the cases, he has all the powers of the Chairman.
              </p>
              <p>
                Like the Chairman, the Deputy Chairman, while presiding over the
                House, cannot vote in the first instance; he can only exercise a
                casting vote in the case of a tie.
              </p>
              <p>
                Further, when a resolution for the removal of the Deputy
                Chairman is under consideration of the House, he cannot preside
                over a sitting of the House, though he may be present.
              </p>
              <p>
                When the Chairman presides over the House, the Deputy Chairman
                is like any other ordinary member of the House. He can speak in
                the House, participate in its proceedings and vote on any
                question before the House in the first instance.
              </p>
              <h3>Panel of Vice-Chairpersons of Rajya Sabha</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Under the Rules of Rajya Sabha, the Chairman nominates from
                  amongst the members a panel of vice-chairpersons. Any one of
                  them can preside over the House in the absence of the Chairman
                  or the Deputy Chairman. He has the same powers as the Chairman
                  when so presiding. He holds office until a new panel of
                  vice-chairpersons is nominated. When a member of the panel of
                  vice chairpersons is also not present, any other person as
                  determined by the House acts as the Chairman.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Note:</b> A member of the panel of vice chairpersons cannot
                  preside over the House, when the office of the Chairman or the
                  Deputy Chairman is vacant. During such time, the Chairman’s
                  duties are to be performed by such member of the House as the
                  president may appoint for the purpose.
                </li>
              </ul>

                <p>
                  Each House of Parliament has separate secretarial staff of its
                  own, though there can be some posts common to both the Houses.
                  Their recruitment and service conditions are regulated by
                  Parliament. The secretariat of each House is headed by a
                  secretary-general. He is a permanent officer and is appointed
                  by the presiding officer of the House.
