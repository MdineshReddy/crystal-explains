                It is the realization of the Gandhian principle listed under
                article 40: To organise village panchayats and endow them with
                necessary powers and authority to enable them to function as
                units of self-government.

              <h2>Evolution of Panchayati Raj</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                Government of India appointed a number of committees to study
                the implementation of self-government at the rural level and
                also recommend steps in achieving this goal. Important of Such
                Committees include:
              </p>
              <h3>Balwant Rai Mehta Committee</h3>
              <p>
                This committee was appointed in 1957, to examine and suggest
                measures for better working of the
                <b>Community Development Programme</b> and the
                <b>National Extension Service</b> . The committee submitted its
                report in November 1957 and recommended the establishment of the
                scheme of <b>‘democratic decentralisation’</b>, which ultimately
                came to be known as Panchayati Raj. The key recommendations by
                the Committee are:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  A <b>Three-tier Panchayati Raj system</b> consisting of Gram
                  Panchayat at the village level, Panchayat Samiti at the block
                  level and Zila Parishad at the district level should be
                  established.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The members of gram panchayat are to be directly elected. The
                  members of Panchayat Samiti and Zila Parishad are to be
                  indirectly elected.
                </li>
                <li>
                  All planning and development activities should be entrusted to
                  these bodies.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Panchayat Samiti should be the executive body and Zila
                  Parishad will act as the advisory, coordinating and
                  supervisory body.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The district collector should be the chairman of the zila
                  parishad.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Adequate resources should be transferred to these bodies to
                  enable them to discharge their duties and fulfil their
                  responsibilities.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                <b>Outcome:</b> These recommendations of the committee were
                accepted by the National Development Council in January 1958.
                The council did not insist on a single rigid pattern and left it
                to the states to evolve their own patterns suitable to local
                conditions. But the basic principles and broad fundamentals
                should be identical throughout the country.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Rajasthan was the first state to establish Panchayati Raj. The
                  scheme was inaugurated by the prime minister on October 2,
                  1959, in Nagaur district.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Rajasthan was followed by Andhra Pradesh, which also adopted
                  the system in 1959. Thereafter, most of the states adopted the
                  system.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Though most of the states created panchayati raj institutions by
                mid 1960s, there were differences from one state to another with
                regard to the number of tiers, relative position of samiti and
                parishad, their tenure, composition, functions, finances and so
                on.

              <h3>Ashok Mehta Committee</h3>
              <p>
                This committee was appointed by Janata Government in 1977 to
                suggest measures to revive and strengthen the declining
                Panchayati Raj system in India. The key recommendations are:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The
                  <b
                    >three-tier system should be replaced with a two-tier
                    system</b
                  >: Zila Parishad (district level) and the Mandal Panchayat (a
                  group of villages).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Zila Parishad should be the executive body and responsible for
                  planning at the district level.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Both the institutions (Zila Parishad and the Mandal Panchayat)
                  should have compulsory powers of taxation to mobilize their
                  own financial resources. There should be a regular social
                  audit by a district level agency.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The nyaya panchayats should be kept as separate bodies from
                  that of development panchayats. They should be presided over
                  by a qualified judge.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A minister for panchayati raj should be appointed in the state
                  council of ministers to look after the affairs of the
                  panchayati raj institutions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Seats for SCs and STs should be reserved on the basis of their
                  population.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A <b>constitutional recognition</b> should be accorded to the
                  Panchayati Raj institutions.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                <b>Outcome:</b> Due to the collapse of the Janata Government
                before the completion of its term, no action could be taken on
                the recommendations of the Ashok Mehta Committee at the central
                level.
              </p>
              <h3>G V K Rao Committee</h3>
              <p>
                This committee was appointed by the planning commission in 1985.
                It recognized that development was not seen at the grassroots
                level due to bureaucratization resulting in Panchayat Raj
                institutions being addressed as ‘grass without roots’. Hence it
                made some key recommendations which are as follows:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The district level body, that is, the Zila Parishad should be
                  of pivotal importance in the scheme of democratic
                  decentralisation. Zila Parishad should be the principal body
                  to manage the developmental programmes at the district level.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Panchayati Raj institutions at the district and lower
                  levels should be assigned an important role with respect to
                  planning, implementation and monitoring of rural development
                  programmes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Some of the planning functions at the state level should be
                  transferred to the district level planning units for effective
                  decentralized district planning.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A post of <b>District Development Commissioner</b> should be
                  created. He should act as the chief executive officer of the
                  Zila Parishad and should be in charge of all the development
                  departments at the district level.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Elections to the Panchayati Raj institutions should be held
                  regularly.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>L M Singhvi Committee</h3>
              <p>
                This committee was appointed by the Government of India (Rajiv
                Gandhi Govt) in 1986 to prepare a concept paper on
                <b>
                  ‘Revitalisation of Panchayati Raj Institutions for Democracy
                  and Development’</b
                >. The following recommendations were made by the committee:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The Panchayati Raj institutions should be
                  <b> constitutionally recognised</b>, protected and preserved.
                  For this purpose, a new chapter should be added in the
                  Constitution of India.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It also suggested constitutional provisions to ensure regular,
                  free and fair elections to the Panchayati Raj bodies.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Nyaya Panchayats should be established for a cluster of
                  villages.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The villages should be reorganised to make Gram Panchayats
                  more viable. It also emphasised the importance of the Gram
                  Sabha and called it as the embodiment of direct democracy.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Village Panchayats should have more financial resources.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The judicial tribunals should be established in each state to
                  adjudicate controversies about election to the Panchayati Raj
                  institutions, their dissolution and other matters related to
                  their functioning.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <br />
              <p>
                <b>Note:</b> Other Committees included Thungon Committee(1988)
                and Gadgil Committee(1988).
              </p>
              <h3>Constitutionalisation</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  The Rajiv Gandhi Government introduced the 64th Constitutional
                  Amendment Bill in the Lok Sabha in July 1989 to
                  constitutionalise panchayati raj institutions and make them
                  more powerful and broad based. Although, the Lok Sabha passed
                  the bill in August 1989, it was not approved by the Rajya
                  Sabha.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The National Front Government (1989) under V.P. Singh
                  introduced a fresh constitutional amendment bill.
                  Consequently, a constitutional amendment bill was introduced
                  in the Lok Sabha in September 1990. However, the fall of the
                  government resulted in the lapse of the bill.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Congress Government under P.V. Narasimha Rao once again
                  introduced a constitutional amendment bill in the Lok Sabha in
                  September, 1991. This bill finally emerged as the 73rd
                  Constitutional Amendment Act, 1992 and came into force on 24
                  April, 1993.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <h3>73RD AMENDMENT ACT OF 1992</h3>
              <p>
                This act added a new <b>Part-IX</b> to the Constitution of
                India. This part is entitled as <b>‘The Panchayats’</b> and
                consists of provisions from <b>Articles 243 to 243 O</b> . In
                addition, the act has also added a new
                <b>Eleventh Schedule</b> to the Constitution. This schedule
                contains 29 functional items of the panchayats. It deals with
                Article 243-G.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Amendment Act provides shape to Article 40 of the
                Constitution, (directive principles of state policy), which
                directs the state to organize the village panchayats and provide
                them powers and authority so that they can function as
                self-government.
              </p>

              <h2>Salient Features of the Act</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <h3>Gram Sabha</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The act provides for a Gram Sabha as the <b>foundation</b> of
                  the Panchayati raj system.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It is a body consisting of all registered voters in the area
                  of a panchayat.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It may exercise such powers and perform such functions at the
                  village level as the legislature of a state determines.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Three-Tier System</h3>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  The act provides for a three-tier system of Panchayati raj in
                  every state i.e, village, intermediate (block or Mandal or
                  Taluka), and district levels.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Thus, the act brings about <b>uniformity</b> in the structure
                  of Panchayati raj throughout the country.
                </li>
                <li>
                  However, a state having a population not exceeding 20 lakhs
                  may not constitute panchayats at the intermediate level.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Election of Members and Chairpersons</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  All the members of panchayats at the village, intermediate and
                  district levels shall be elected directly by the people.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The chairperson of panchayats at the intermediate and district
                  levels shall be elected indirectly–by and from amongst the
                  elected members thereof.
                </li>
                <li>
                  However, the chairperson of a panchayat at the village level
                  shall be elected in such manner as the state legislature
                  determines.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The chairperson of a panchayat and other members of a
                  panchayat elected directly or indirectly shall have the right
                  to vote in the meetings of the panchayats.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Reservation of Seats</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>For SC and ST:</b> Reservation to be provided at all the
                  three tiers in accordance with their population percentage.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>For women:</b> Not less than one-third of the total number
                  of seats to be reserved for women.

              </p>

              <h3>Exempted states and areas</h3>
              <p>
                The Act does not apply to the states of Nagaland, Meghalaya and
                Mizoram and certain other areas. These areas include:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>The scheduled areas and the tribal areas in the states</li>

                However, Parliament can extend this part to these areas subject
                to the exception and modification it specifies. Thus, the PESA
                Act was enacted.

                    The Parliament can extend this Part to such areas with
