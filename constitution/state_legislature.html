              <h1 class="title">State Legislature</h1>
              <p>
                There is no uniformity in the creation of State Legislatures.
                Most of the states have unicameral system (single house), only 6
                States: Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Uttar
                Pradesh and Telengana are having Bicameral (Double House).
              </p>
              <p>
                For the states having unicameral system, the state legislature
                consists of the governor and the legislative assembly.

              <p>
                For the states having bicameral system, the state legislature
                consist of the governor, the legislative council and the
                legislative assembly. The legislative council (Vidhan Parishad)
                is the upper house (second chamber or house of elders), while
                the legislative assembly (Vidhan Sabha) is the lower house
                (first chamber or popular house).

              <h3>Creation and Abolition of Legislative Councils</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The Constitution provides for the abolition or creation of
                  legislative councils in states. Accordingly, the Parliament
                  can abolish a legislative council (where it already exists) or
                  create it (where it does not exist), if the legislative
                  assembly of the concerned state passes a resolution to that
                  effect.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Such a specific resolution must be passed by the state
                  assembly by a
                  <b>special majority</b> , that is, a majority of the total
                  membership of the assembly and a majority of not less than
                  two-thirds of the members of the assembly present and voting.
                </li>

                <li>
                  This Act of Parliament is not to be deemed as an amendment of
                  the Constitution for the purposes of Article 368 and is passed
                  like an ordinary piece of legislation (i.e., by simple
                  majority).
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Andhra Pradesh got the legislative council created in 1957 and
                got the same abolished in 1985. The Legislative Council in
                Andhra Pradesh was again revived in 2007, after the enactment of
                the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Council Act, 2005. In January
                2020, AP Legislative Assembly again passed a resolution for
                dissolution of the Legislative Council. This resolution is yet
                to be cleared by the Parliament of India to finally abolish the
                council.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  The Governor is an integral component of the State
                  Legislature.
                </li>
                <li>
                  No bill can become an act without his assent (or President's

                </li>
                <li>
                  The Governor's responsibility is to ensure that laws passed by
                  the State Legislature are in accordance with the

              <h3>Composition of Legislative Assembly</h3>
              <h4>Stength</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The legislative assembly consists of representatives directly
                  elected by the people on the basis of universal adult
                  franchise.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Its maximum strength is fixed at 500 and minimum strength at
                  60. However, in case of Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim and Goa, the
                  minimum number is fixed at 30 and in case of Mizoram and
                  Nagaland, it is 40 and 46 respectively.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Further, some members of the legislative assemblies in Sikkim
                  and Nagaland are also elected indirectly.
                </li>
              </ul>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Between 1952 and 2020, 1 seat was reserved for members of
                    the Anglo-Indian community in Legislative Assemblies who was
                    to be nominated by the Governor. But 104th Amendment Act
                    (Dec 2019) abolished this practice.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The 104th Amendment of the Constitution of India, extended
                    the deadline for the cessation for the reservation of seats
                    for members from Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in
                    the Lok Sabha and State Legislative Assemblies by a period
                    of 10 years (until 2030).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    For the purpose of holding direct elections to the assembly,
                    each state is divided into
                    <b>territorial constituencies</b>. The number of seats
                    allotted to a constituency depends on its population.

              <h3>Composition of Legislative Council</h3>
              <h4>Strength</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Unlike the members of the legislative assembly, the members of
                  the legislative council are indirectly elected.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The maximum strength of the council is fixed at
                  <b>one-third</b> of the total strength of the assembly and the
                  minimum strength is fixed at 40. It means that the size of the
                  council depends on the size of the assembly of the concerned
                  state.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Manner of Election</h4>
              <p>Of the total number of members of a legislative council:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  1/3 are elected by the members of local bodies in the state
                  like municipalities, district boards, etc.,
                </li>
                <li>
                  1/12 are elected by graduates of three years standing and
                  residing within the state,
                </li>
                <li>
                  1/12 are elected by teachers of three years standing in the
                  state, not lower in standard than secondary school.
                </li>
                <li>
                  1/3 are elected by the members of the legislative assembly of
                  the state from amongst persons who are not members of the
                  assembly, and
                </li>
                <li>
                  1/6 are nominated by the governor from amongst persons who
                  have a special knowledge or practical experience of
                  literature, science, art, cooperative movement and social
                  service.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Thus, 5/6 of the total number of members of a legislative
                council are indirectly elected and 1/6 are nominated by the
                governor. The members are elected in accordance with the system
                of proportional representation by means of a single transferable
                vote.

              <h2>Duration of Two Houses</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <h3>Duration of Assembly</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Like the Lok Sabha, the legislative assembly is not a
                  continuing chamber.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Its normal term is five years from the date of its first
                  meeting after the general elections.
                </li>
                <li>
                  However, the governor is authorized to dissolve the assembly
                  at any time to pave the way for fresh elections.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Further, the term of the assembly can be extended during the
                  period of national emergency by a law of Parliament for one
                  year at a time (for any length of time). However, this
                  extension cannot continue beyond a period of six months after
                  the emergency has ceased to operate. This means that the
                  assembly should be re-elected within six months after the
                  revocation of emergency.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Duration of the Council</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Like the Rajya Sabha, the legislative council is a continuing
                  chamber, that is, it is a permanent body and is not subject to
                  dissolution.
                </li>
                <li>
                  But, one-third of its members retire on the expiration of
                  every second year. So, a member continues as such for six
                  years.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The vacant seats are filled up by fresh elections and
                  nominations (by governor) at the beginning of every third
                  year. The retiring members are also eligible for re-election
                  and re-nomination any number of times.
                </li>
              </ul>

                <b>Qualifications:</b> The Constitution lays down the following

              </ol>

              <p>
                Accordingly, the Parliament has laid down the following
                additional qualifications in the Representation of People Act
                (1951):
              </p>
              <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">

                  He must be a member of a scheduled caste or scheduled tribe if

                </li>
              </ol>
              <h3>Disqualifications</h3>
              <p>
                Under the Constitution, a person shall be disqualified for being
                chosen as and for being a member of the legislative assembly or
                legislative council of a state:
              </p>
              <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
                <li>

                </li>
                <li>
                  if he is of unsound mind and stands so declared by a court,
                </li>
                <li>if he is an undischarged insolvent,</li>
                <li>
                  if he is not a citizen of India or has voluntarily acquired
                  the citizenship of a foreign state or is under any
                  acknowledgement of allegiance to a foreign state, and
                </li>
                <li>
                  if he is so disqualified under any law made by Parliament.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                Accordingly, the Parliament has prescribed a number of
                additional disqualifications in the Representation of People Act
                (1951):
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  He must not have been found guilty of certain election
                  offences or corrupt practices in the elections.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He must not have been convicted for any offence resulting in
                  imprisonment for two or more years. But, the detention of a
                  person under a preventive detention law is not a
                  disqualification.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He must not have failed to lodge an account of his election
                  expenses within the time.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He must neither hold an office of profit under the government
                  nor have any interest in government contracts.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He must not have been dismissed from government service for
                  corruption or disloyalty to the state.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He must not have been convicted for promoting enmity between
                  different groups or for the offence of bribery.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He must not have been punished for preaching and practicing
                  social crimes such as untouchability, dowry and sati.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                On the question whether a member has become subject to any of
                the above disqualifications, the governor’s decision is final.
                However, he should obtain the opinion of the Election Commission
                and act accordingly.
              </p>
              <h3>Disqualification on Ground of Defection</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The Constitution also lays down that a person shall be
                  disqualified for being a member of either House of state
                  legislature if he is so disqualified on the ground of
                  defection under the provisions of the Tenth Schedule.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The question of disqualification under the Tenth Schedule is
                  decided by the Chairman, in the case of legislative council
                  and, Speaker, in the case of legislative assembly (and not by
                  the governor).
                </li>
                <li>
                  In 1992, the Supreme Court ruled that the decision of
                  Chairman/Speaker in this regard is subject to judicial review.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Oath</h3>
              <p>
                Every member of either House of state legislature, before taking
                his seat in the House, has to make and subscribe an oath or
                affirmation before the governor or some person appointed by him
                for this purpose. In this oath, a member of the state
                legislature swears:
              </p>
              <p>
                "I, (name), do swear in the name of God (or solemnly affirm)
                that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution
                of India as by law established, that I will uphold the
                sovereignty and integrity of India, that I will faithfully and
                conscientiously discharge my duty upon which I am about to
                enter."
              </p>

              <h3>Vacation of Seats</h3>
              <p>
                In the following cases, a member of the state legislature
                vacates his seat:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Double Membership:</b> A person cannot be a member of both
                  Houses of state legislature at one and the same time.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b> Disqualification:</b> If a member of the state legislature
                  becomes subject to any of the disqualifications, his seat
                  becomes vacant.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Resignation:</b> A member may resign his seat by writing to
                  the Chairman of legislative council or Speaker of legislative
                  assembly, as the case may be. The seat falls vacant when the
                  resignation is accepted.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b> Absence:</b> A House of the state legislature can declare
                  the seat of a member vacant if he absents himself from all its

                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Other Cases:</b> A member has to vacate his seat in the
                  either House of state legislature, (i) if his election is
                  declared void by the court, (ii) if he is expelled by the
                  House, (iii) if he is elected to the office of president or
                  office of vice-president or office of governor of a state.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Presiding Officers of State Legislature</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                Each House of state legislature has its own presiding officer.
                There is a Speaker and a Deputy Speaker for the legislative
                assembly and a Chairman and a Deputy Chairman for the
                legislative council. A panel of chairman for the assembly and a
                panel of vice-chairman for the council is also appointed.
              </p>
              <h3>Speaker of Assembly</h3>
              <p>
                The Speaker is elected by the assembly itself from amongst its
                members. Usually, the Speaker remains in office during the life
                of the assembly. However, he vacates his office earlier in any
                of the following three cases :
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>if he ceases to be a member of the assembly.</li>
                <li>if he resigns by writing to the deputy speaker and</li>
                <li>
                  if he is removed by a resolution passed by a majority of all
                  the then members (effective majority) of the assembly. Such a
                  resolution can be moved only after giving 14 days advance
                  notice.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p><b>The Speaker has the following powers and duties:</b></p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  He maintains order and decorum in the assembly for conducting
                  its business and regulating its proceedings.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He is the final interpreter of the provisions of (a) the
                  Constitution of India, (b) the rules of procedure and conduct
                  of business of assembly, and (c) the legislative precedents,
                  within the assembly.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He adjourns the assembly or suspends the meeting in the
                  absence of a quorum.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He does not vote in the first instance. But he can exercise a
                  casting vote in the case of a tie.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He can allow a ‘secret’ sitting of the House at the request of
                  the leader of the House.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He decides whether a bill is a Money Bill or not and his
                  decision on this question is final.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He decides the questions of disqualification of a member of
                  the assembly, arising on the ground of defection under the
                  provisions of the Tenth Schedule.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He appoints the chairman of all the committees of the assembly
                  and supervises their functioning. He himself is the chairman
                  of the Business Advisory Committee, the Rules Committee and
                  the General-Purpose Committee.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Deputy Speaker of Assembly</h3>
              <p>
                Like the Speaker, the Deputy Speaker is also elected by the
                assembly itself from amongst its members. He is elected after
                the election of the Speaker has taken place. Like the Speaker,
                the Deputy Speaker remains in office usually during the life of
                the assembly. However, he also vacates his office earlier in any
                of the following three cases:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>if he ceases to be a member of the assembly.</li>
                <li>if he resigns by writing to the speaker and</li>
                <li>
                  if he is removed by a resolution passed by a majority of all
                  the then members (effective majority) of the assembly. Such a
                  resolution can be moved only after giving 14 days advance
                  notice.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                The Deputy Speaker performs the duties of the Speaker’s office
                when it is vacant. He also acts as the Speaker when the latter
                is absent from the sitting of assembly. In both the cases, he
                has all the powers of the Speaker.
              </p>
              <h3>Panel of chairman for the assembly</h3>
              <p>
                The Speaker nominates from amongst the members a panel of
                chairman. Any one of them can preside over the assembly in the
                absence of the Speaker or the Deputy Speaker. He has the same
                powers as the speaker when so presiding.
              </p>
              <h3>Chairman of Council</h3>
              <p>
                The Chairman is elected by the council itself from amongst its
                members. The Chairman vacates his office in any of the following
                three cases:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>if he ceases to be a member of the council.</li>
                <li>if he resigns by writing to the deputy chairman and</li>
                <li>
                  if he is removed by a resolution passed by a majority of all
                  the then members (effective majority) of the council. Such a
                  resolution can be moved only after giving 14 days advance
                  notice.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                As a presiding officer, the powers and functions of the Chairman
                in the council are similar to those of the Speaker in the
                assembly. However, the Speaker has one special power which is
                not enjoyed by the Chairman. The Speaker decides whether a bill
                is a Money Bill or not and his decision on this question is
                final.
              </p>
              <p>
                The salaries and allowances of the Speaker and the Deputy
                Speaker of the assembly and the Chairman and the Deputy Chairman
                of the council are fixed by the state legislature. They are
                charged on the Consolidated Fund of the State and thus are not
                subject to the annual vote of the state legislature.
              </p>
              <h3>Deputy Chairman of Council</h3>
              <p>
                Like the Chairman, the Deputy Chairman is also elected by the
                council itself from amongst its members. The deputy chairman
                vacates his office in any of the following three cases:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>if he ceases to be a member of the council.</li>
                <li>if he resigns by writing to the Chairman and</li>
                <li>
                  if he is removed by a resolution passed by a majority of all
                  the then members (effective majority) of the council. Such a
                  resolution can be moved only after giving 14 days advance
                  notice.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                The Deputy Chairman performs the duties of the Chairman’s office
                when it is vacant. He also acts as the Chairman when the latter
                is absent from the sitting of the council. In both the cases, he
                has all the powers of the Chairman.
              </p>
              <h3>Panel of Vice-Chairman for the Council</h3>
              <p>
                The Chairman nominates from amongst the members a panel of
                vice-chairman. Any one of them can preside over the council in
                the absence of the Chairman or the Deputy Chairman. He has the
                same powers as the chairman when so presiding. He holds office
                until a new panel of vice-chairman is nominated.
              </p>
              <h2>Session of State Legislature</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <h3>Summoning</h3>
              <p>
                The governor from time to time summons each House of state
                legislature to meet. The maximum gap between the two sessions of
                state legislature cannot be more than six months, i.e., the
                state legislature should meet at least twice a year. A session
                of the state legislature consists of many sittings.
              </p>
              <h3>Adjournment</h3>
              <p>
                An adjournment suspends the work in a sitting for a specified
                time which may be hours, days or weeks. Adjournment sine die
                means terminating a sitting of the state legislature for an
                indefinite period. The power of the adjournment as well as
                adjournment sine die lies with the presiding officer of the
                House.
              </p>
              <h3>Prorogation</h3>
              <p>
                When the business of the session is completed, the governor
                issues a notification for prorogation of the session. However,
                the governor can also prorogue the House which is in session.
                Unlike an adjournment, a prorogation terminates a session of the
                House.
              </p>
              <h3>Dissolution</h3>
              <p>
                The legislative council, being a permanent house, is not subject
                to dissolution. Only the legislative assembly is subject to
                dissolution. Unlike a prorogation, a dissolution ends the very
                life of the existing House, and a new House is constituted after
                the general elections are held.
              </p>
              <h4>
                Status of Bills incase of dissolution of Legislative Assembly
              </h4>
              <p>
                The position with respect to lapsing of bills on the dissolution
                of the assembly is mentioned below:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  A Bill pending in the assembly lapses (whether originating in
                  the assembly or transmitted to it by the council).
                </li>
                <li>
                  A Bill passed by the assembly but pending in the council
                  lapses.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A Bill pending in the council but not passed by the assembly
                  does not lapse.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A Bill passed by the assembly (in a unicameral state) or
                  passed by both the houses (in a bicameral state) but pending
                  assent of the governor or the President does not lapse.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A Bill passed by the assembly (in a unicameral state) or
                  passed by both the Houses (in a bicameral state) but returned
                  by the president for reconsideration of House (s) does not
                  lapse.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <h3>Quorum</h3>
              <p>
                Quorum is the minimum number of members required to be present
                in the House before it can transact any business. It is
                <b>ten members</b> or
                <b>one-tenth</b>
                of the total number of members of the House (including the
                presiding officer), whichever is greater.
              </p>
              <p>
                If there is no quorum during a meeting of the House, it is the
                duty of the presiding officer either to adjourn the House or to
                suspend the meeting until there is a quorum.
              </p>
              <h3>Voting In House</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  All matters at any sitting of either House are decided by a
                  majority of votes of the members present and voting excluding
                  the presiding officer. The presiding officer (i.e., Speaker in
                  the case of assembly or chairman in the case of council or the
                  person acting as such) does not vote in the first instance,
                  but exercises a casting vote in the case of an equality of
                  votes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Only a few matters which are specifically mentioned in the
                  Constitution like removal of the speaker of the assembly and
                  so on require special majority, not ordinary majority.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Language in State Legislature</h3>

              <p>
                The Constitution has declared the official language(s) of the
                state or Hindi or English, to be the languages for transacting
                business in the state legislature. However, the presiding
                officer can permit a member to address the House in his
                mother-tongue.
              </p>

              <h3>Rights of Ministers and Advocate General</h3>
              <p>
                In addition to the members of a House, every minister and the
                advocate general of the state have the right to speak and take
                part in the proceedings of either House or any of its committees
                of which he is named a member, without being entitled to vote.

              <h2>Legislative Procedure in State Legislature</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <h3>Ordinary Bills</h3>
              <h4>Bill in the Originating House</h4>
              <p>
                An ordinary bill can originate in either House of the state
                legislature (in case of a bicameral legislature). Such a bill
                can be introduced either by a minister or by any other member.
                The bill passes through three stages in the originating House:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>First reading</li>
                <li>Second reading</li>
                <li>Third reading.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                After the bill is passed by the originating House, it is
                transmitted to the second House for consideration and passage. A
                bill is deemed to have been passed by the state legislature only
                when both the Houses have agreed to it, either with or without
                amendments. In case of a unicameral legislature, a bill passed
                by the legislative assembly is sent directly to the governor for
                his assent.
              </p>

              <h4>Bill in the Second House</h4>
              <p>
                In the second House also, the bill passes through all the above
                stages except the introductory stage.
              </p>
              <p>
                When a bill is passed by the legislative assembly and
                transmitted to the legislative council, the latter has four
                alternatives before it:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  The Council may pass the bill as sent by the assembly without
                  amendments. The bill is deemed to have been passed by both the
                  Houses and the same is sent to the governor for his assent.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The council may pass the bill with amendments and return it to
                  the assembly for reconsideration. The assembly has two
                  alternatives:
                </li>
                <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
                  <li>
                    The assembly accepts the amendments suggested by the
                    council, the bill is deemed to have been passed by both the
                    Houses and the same is sent to the governor for his assent.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The assembly rejects the amendments suggested by the
                    council. Then also the bill is deemed to have been passed by
                    both the Houses and the bill in its original form is sent to
                    the governor for his assent.
                  </li>
                </ol>
                <li>
                  The council may reject the bill altogether. Then also the bill
                  is deemed to have been passed by both the Houses in the form
                  in which it was passed by the assembly.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Council may not take any action and thus keep the bill
                  pending. After <b> three months</b>, the assembly may pass the
                  bill again and transmit the same to the council. If the
                  council rejects the bill again or passes the bill with
                  amendments not acceptable to the assembly or does not pass the
                  bill within one month, then the bill is deemed to have been
                  passed by both the Houses in the form in which it was passed
                  by the assembly for the second time.
                </li>
              </ol>

              <p>
                Therefore, the ultimate power of passing an ordinary bill is
                vested in the assembly. At the most, the council can detain or
                delay the bill for a period of four months–three months in the
                first instance and one month in the second instance. The
                Constitution does not provide for the mechanism of joint sitting
                of both the Houses to resolve the disagreement between the two
                Houses over a bill.
              </p>
              <p>
                Moreover, when a bill, which has originated in the council and
                was sent to the assembly, is rejected by the assembly, the bill
                ends and becomes dead.
              </p>
              <h4>Assent of the Governor</h4>
              <p>
                Every bill, after it is passed by the assembly or by both the
                Houses in case of a bicameral legislature, is presented to the
                governor for his assent. There are four alternatives before the
                governor:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>he may give his assent to the bill</li>
                <li>he may withhold his assent to the bill</li>
                <li>
                  he may return the bill for reconsideration of the House or
                  Houses and
                </li>
                <li>
                  he may reserve the bill for the consideration of the
                  President.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                If the governor gives his assent to the bill, the bill becomes
                an Act and is placed on the Statute Book. If the governor
                withholds his assent to the bill, the bill ends and does not
                become an Act. If the governor returns the bill for
                reconsideration and if the bill is passed by the House or both
                the Houses again, with or without amendments, and presented to
                the governor for his assent, the governor must give his assent
                to the bill. Thus, the governor enjoys only a suspensive veto.
              </p>
              <h4>Assent of the President</h4>
              <p>
                When a bill is reserved by the governor for the consideration of
                the President, the President may either:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>give his assent to the bill or</li>
                <li>withhold his assent to the bill or</li>
                <li>
                  return the bill for reconsideration of the House or Houses of
                  the state legislature.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                When a bill is so returned, the House or Houses have to
                reconsider it within a period of six months. The bill is
                presented again to the presidential assent after it is passed by
                the House or Houses with or without amendments. It is not
                mentioned in the Constitution whether it is obligatory on the
                part of the president to give his assent to such a bill or not.
              </p>

              <h3>Money Bills</h3>
              <p>
                The Constitution lays down a special procedure for the passing
                of Money Bills in the state legislature. This is as follows:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  A Money Bill cannot be introduced in the legislative council.
                  It can be introduced in the legislative assembly only and that
                  too on the recommendation of the governor.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Every such bill is considered to be a government bill and can
                  be introduced only by a minister.
                </li>
                <li>
                  After a Money Bill is passed by the legislative assembly, it
                  is transmitted to the legislative council for its
                  consideration. The legislative council cannot reject or amend
                  a Money Bill. It can only make recommendations and must return
                  the bill to the legislative assembly within 14 days. The
                  legislative assembly can either accept or reject all or any of
                  the recommendations of the legislative council. If the
                  legislative assembly accepts any recommendation, the bill is
                  then deemed to have been passed by both the Houses in the
                  modified form. If the legislative assembly does not accept any
                  recommendation, the bill is then deemed to have been passed by
                  both the Houses in the form originally passed by the
                  legislative assembly without any change. If the legislative
                  council does not return the bill to the legislative assembly
                  within 14 days, the bill is deemed to have been passed by both
                  Houses in the form originally passed by the legislative
                  assembly. At the most, the legislative council can detain or
                  delay a money bill for a period of 14 days.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Finally, when a Money Bill is presented to the governor, he
                  may either give his assent, withhold his assent or reserve the
                  bill for presidential assent but cannot return the bill for
                  reconsideration of the state legislature. Normally, the
                  governor gives his assent to a money bill as it is introduced
                  in the state legislature with his prior permission. When a
                  money bill is reserved for consideration of the President, the
                  president may either give his assent to the bill or withhold
                  his assent to the bill but cannot return the bill for
                  reconsideration of the state legislature.
