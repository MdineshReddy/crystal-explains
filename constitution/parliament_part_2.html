                summons each House of Parliament to meet.
              </p>
              <p>
                The maximum gap between two sessions of Parliament cannot be
                more than <b> six months</b> i.e., the Parliament should meet at
                least twice ayear. There are typically three sessions in a year:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>Budget Session (February to May)</li>
                <li>Monsoon Session (July to September) and</li>
                <li>Winter Session (November to December).</li>
              </ol>

              <p>
                A session of Parliament consists of many meetings. Each meeting
                spans a day consisting of two sittings, that is, a morning
                sitting from 11 am to 1 pm and post-lunch sitting from 2 pm to 6
                pm. A sitting of Parliament can be terminated by adjournment or
                adjournment sine die or prorogation or dissolution (in the case
                of the Lok Sabha).
              </p>
              <h3>Adjournment</h3>
              <p>
                An adjournment suspends the work in a sitting for a specified
                time, which may be hours, days or weeks
              </p>
              <h3>Adjournment Sine Die</h3>
              <p>
                Adjournment sine die means terminating a sitting of Parliament
                for an indefinite period.
              </p>
              <div class="note">
                <p>
                  <b>Note:</b> The power of adjournment as well as adjournment
                  sine die lies with the <b> presiding officer of the House</b>.
                </p>
              </div>
              <h3>Prorogation</h3>
              <p>
                When the business of a particular session is completed, the
                <b>President</b> issues a notification for prorogation of the
                session. However, the President can also prorogue the House
                while in session. The period spanning between the prorogation of
                a House and its reassembly in a new session is called
                <b> ‘recess’</b>.
              </p>

              <h3>Dissolution of Lok Sabha</h3>
              <p>
                Unlike a prorogation, a dissolution ends the very life of the
                existing House, and a new House is constituted after general
                elections are held. Rajya Sabha, being a permanent House, is not
                subject to dissolution. The dissolution of the Lok Sabha may
                take place in either of two ways:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <b>Automatic dissolution</b>, that is, on the expiry of its
                  tenure of five years or the terms as extended during a
                  national emergency or
                </li>
                <li>Whenever the President decides to dissolve the House.</li>
              </ol>
              <div class="note">
                <h3 style="text-align: center">
                  When can the President give the order for Lok Sabha’s
                  dissolution?

                  <li>
                    If authorized by the Council of Ministers, he can give the
                    order even before the end of the five-year term.

                  <li>
                    He can also dissolve if the Council of Ministers loses
                    confidence and no party is able to prove majority.

              <h4>Status of bills when Lok Sabha is dissolved:</h4>
              <p>
                When the Lok Sabha is dissolved, the position with respect to
                lapsing of bills is as follows:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  A bill pending in the Lok Sabha lapses (whether originating in
                  the Lok Sabha or transmitted to it by the Rajya Sabha).
                </li>
                <li>
                  A bill passed by the Lok Sabha but pending in the Rajya Sabha
                  lapses.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A bill not passed by the two Houses due to disagreement and if
                  the president has notified the holding of a joint sitting
                  before the dissolution of Lok Sabha, does not lapse.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A bill pending in the Rajya Sabha but not passed by the Lok
                  Sabha does not lapse.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A bill passed by both Houses but pending assent of the
                  president does not lapse.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A bill passed by both Houses but returned by the president for
                  reconsideration of Houses does not lapse.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <div class="note">
                <h4 style="text-align: center">Lame-Duck Session</h4>
                <p>
                  It refers to the last session of the existing Lok Sabha, after
                  a new Lok Sabha has been elected. Those members of the
                  existing Lok Sabha who could not get re-elected to the new Lok
                  Sabha are called lame-ducks
                </p>
              </div>
              <h4>Quorum</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Quorum is the minimum number of members required to be present
                  in the House before it can transact any business.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It is <b>one-tenth</b> of the total number of members in each
                  House including the presiding officer i.e., that there must be
                  at least 55 members present in the Lok Sabha and 25 members
                  present in the Rajya Sabha, if any business is to be
                  conducted.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If there is no quorum, it is the duty of the presiding officer
                  either to adjourn the House or to suspend the meeting until
                  there is a quorum.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Voting in House</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  All matters at any sitting of either House or joint sitting of
                  both the Houses are decided by a majority of votes of the
                  members present and voting, excluding the presiding officer.
                  The presiding officer of a House does not vote in the first
                  instance, but exercises a casting vote in the case of an
                  equality of votes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Only a few matters, which are specifically mentioned in the
                  Constitution like impeachment of the President, amendment of
                  the Constitution and so on, require special majority.

              <h4>Language in Parliament</h4>
              <p>
                The Constitution has declared Hindi and English to be the
                languages for transacting business in the Parliament. However,
                the presiding officer can permit a member to address the House
                in his mother-tongue. In both the Houses, arrangements are made
                for simultaneous translation.
              </p>

              <h4>Rights of Ministers and Attorney General</h4>
              <p>
                In addition to the members of a House, every minister and the
                attorney general of India have the right to speak and take part
                in the proceedings of either House, any joint sitting of both
                the Houses and any committee of Parliament of which he is a
                member, without being entitled to vote.

              <h2>Devices of Parliamentary Proceedings</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <h3>Question Hour</h3>
              <p>
                The first hour of every parliamentary sitting is alotted for
                Question Hour during which, the members of the house ask
                questions and the ministers 'usually' give answers. The
                questions are of three kinds:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  A <b> starred question</b> (distinguished by an asterisk)
                  requires an oral answer and hence supplementary questions can
                  follow.
                </li>
                <li>
                  An <b> unstarred question</b>, on the other hand, requires a
                  written answer and hence, supplementary questions cannot
                  follow.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A <b>short notice question</b> is one that is asked by giving
                  a notice of less than ten days. It is answered orally.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                In addition to the ministers, the questions can also be asked to
                the private members if the subject matter of the question
                relates to the business of the House for which that member is
                responsible.
              </p>
              <h3>Zero Hour</h3>
              <p>
                Zero hour is an informal device available to the members of the
                Parliament to raise matters without any prior notice. It starts
                right after the question hour and lasts until the agenda for the
                day (i.e., regular business of the House) is taken up.
              </p>
              <h3>Motions</h3>
              <p>
                A motion is a formal proposal by a minister (or private member)
                to do something. No discussion on a matter can be taken without
                moving a motion with prior consent of the presiding officer. The
                House may either adopt or reject the motions moved by either
                ministers or private members. The motions fall into three
                principal categories:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <b>Substantive (main/original) Motion:</b> It is a
                  self-contained independent proposal dealing with a important
                  matter.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b> Substitute Motion:</b> It is a motion that is moved in
                  substitution of an original motion and proposes an alternative
                  to it. If adopted by the House, it supersedes the original
                  motion.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b> Subsidiary Motion:</b> It is a motion that, by itself, has
                  no meaning and cannot state the decision of the House without
                  reference to the original motion or proceedings of the House.
                  It is further divided into three sub-categories:
                </li>
                <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
                  <li>
                    <b> Ancillary Motion:</b> It is used as the regular way of
                    proceeding with various kinds of business like proposal for
                    a bill, consideration of a bill, passage of a bill etc.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Superseding Motion:</b> It is moved in the course of
                    debate on another issue and seeks to supersede that issue.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Amendment:</b> It seeks to modify or substitute only a
                    part of the original motion.
                  </li>
                </ol>
              </ol>
              <h2>Important Motions</h2>
              <h3>Closure Motion</h3>
              <p>
                It is a motion moved by a member to cut short the debate on a
                matter before the House. If the motion is approved by the House,
                debate is stopped forthwith and the matter is put to vote. There
                are four kinds of closure motions:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <b> Simple Closure:</b> It is one when a member moves that the
                  ‘matter having been sufficiently discussed be now put to
                  vote’.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Closure by Compartments:</b> In this case, the clauses of a
                  bill or a lengthy resolution are grouped into parts before the
                  commencement of the debate. The debate covers the part as a
                  whole and the entire part is put to vote.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Kangaroo Closure:</b> Under this type, only important
                  clauses are taken up for debate and voting and the intervening
                  clauses are skipped over and taken as passed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b> Guillotine Closure:</b> It is one when the undiscussed
                  clauses of a bill or a resolution are also put to vote along
                  with the discussed ones due to lack of time.
                </li>
              </ol>

              <h3>No-Confidence Motion</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Article 75 of the Constitution says that the council of
                  ministers shall be collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha.
                  It means that the ministry stays in office so long as it
                  enjoys confidence of the majority of the members of the Lok
                  Sabha.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In other words, the Lok Sabha can remove the ministry from
                  office by passing a no-confidence motion. The motion needs the
                  support of 50 members to be admitted.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Confidence Motion</h3>

              <p>
                The government can sometimes, on its own, seeks to prove its
                majority by moving a motion of confidence and winning the
                confidence of the House. If the confidence motion is negatived,
                it results in the fall of the government.
              </p>

              <h3>Censure Motion</h3>
              <p>
                A censure literally means expression of strong disapproval or
                harsh criticism, generally by opposition against the policies of
                Government or an individual minister. However, it can also be
                passed to criticize, condemn some act. A censure motion can be
                moved in Lok Sabha or in a state assembly.
              </p>
              <h3>Censure Motion vs No Confidence Motion</h3>

              <div class="table-container">

              <h3>Resolutions</h3>
              <p>
                The members can move resolutions to draw the attention of the
                House or the government to matters of general public interest.
                Resolutions are classified into three categories:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <b>Private Member’s Resolution:</b> It is one that is moved by
                  a private member (other than a minister).
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b> Government Resolution:</b> It is one that is moved by a
                  minister.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b> Statutory Resolution:</b> It can be moved either by a
                  private member or a minister. It is so called because it is
                  always tabled in pursuance of a provision in the Constitution
                  or an Act of Parliament.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                <b>Note:</b> All resolutions come in the category of substantive
                motions, that is to say, every resolution is a particular type
                of motion. All motions need not necessarily be substantive.
                Further, all motions are not necessarily put to vote of the
                House, whereas all the resolutions are required to be voted
                upon.
              </p>

              <h3>Legislative Procedure in Parliament</h3>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                A bill is a proposal for legislation and it becomes an act or
                law when duly enacted. The procedure followed in both houses to
                pass the bill for it to become an act is same.
              </p>
              <p>Bills are of two types:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Public Bill (or government bills) is introduced in the
                  Parliament by a minister. It requires a 7 day's notice prior
                  to its introduction in the house.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Private Bill is introduced by any member of Parliament other
                  than a minister. It requires 1 month's notice prior to its
                  introduction in the house.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                Based on their purpose, bills are classified into four
                categories:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <b> Ordinary bills</b>, which are concerned with any matter
                  other than financial subjects.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Money bills</b> , which are concerned with the financial
                  matters like taxation, public expenditure, etc.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Financial bills</b>, which are also concerned with
                  financial matters but are different from money bills.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Constitution amendment bills</b>, which are concerned with
                  the amendment of the provisions of the Constitution. They are
                  discussed under
                  <a href='/constitution/constitutional_amendment.html'>Amendment of Constitution</a
                  >.
                </li>
              </ol>

              <h3>Ordinary Bills</h3>
              <p>
                Every ordinary bill has to pass through the following five
                stages in the Parliament before it becomes an act and finds a
                place on the Statute Book:
              </p>
              <h4>1. First Reading</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  A minister (public bill) or any other member of parliament
                  other than a minister (private bill) can introduce the bill in
                  either House of Parliament.
                </li>

                <li>
                  The member who wants to introduce the bill has to ask for the
                  leave of the House. When the House grants leave, the mover of
                  the bill introduces it by reading its title and objectives. No
                  discussion on the bill takes place at this stage.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Later, the bill is published in the <b> Gazette of India</b>.
                  This constitute the first reading of the bill. Even before
                  introduction, a bill might with the permission of the speaker,
                  be published in the Gazette. In such cases, leave to introduce
                  the bill the house is not asked for and the bill is straight
                  away introduced.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h4>2. Second Reading</h4>
              <p>
                During this stage, the bill receives detailed scrutiny and
                assumes its final shape. This stage involves three more
                sub-stages, namely, general discussion, committee stage and
                consideration stage.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>General Discussion:</b> The printed copies of the bill are
                  given to all house members. The house can take the bill for
                  immediate consideration or at a fixed date. The bill can be
                  referred to a select committee of that house or a joint
                  committee of both houses. It can also be circulated for public
                  opinion.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Committee Stage:</b> The committee examines the bill
                  thoroughly and in detail, clause by clause. It can also amend
                  its provisions, but without altering the principles underlying
                  it. After completing the scrutiny and discussion, the
                  committee reports the bill back to the House.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Consideration Stage:</b> The House, after receiving the
                  bill from the committee, considers the provisions of the bill
                  clause by clause. Each clause is discussed and voted upon
                  separately. The members can also move amendments and if
                  accepted, they become part of the bill.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h4>3. Third Reading</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The bill as a whole is discussed and voted; no amendments are
                  allowed at this stage.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If the bill is passed by a simple majority then it’s
                  authenticated by the presiding officer and goes to the second
                  house.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h4>4. Bill in the other house</h4>
              <p>
                In the second House also, the bill goes through the stages
                described above, except the introduction stage. There are four
                alternatives scenarios:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  The Second house may pass the bill as sent by the first house
                  without any amendments. Then the bill is deemed to have been
                  passed by both the Houses and the same is sent to the
                  president for his assent.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Second house may pass the bill with amendments and return
                  it to the first House for reconsideration. In this case, there
                  are two alternatives:
                </li>
                <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
                  <li>
                    If the originating house accepts the amendments suggested by
                    the second House, the bill is deemed to have been passed by
                    both the Houses and the same is sent to the president for
                    his assent.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If the originating house does not agree with the amendments,
                    it will be a deadlock and a <b>Joint sitting</b> will be
                    summoned by the President (under Article 108).
                  </li>
                </ol>
                <li>
                  The second house may reject the bill altogether. This results
                  in a deadlock and a <b>Joint sitting</b> will be summoned by
                  the President (under Article 108).
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Second House may not take any action and thus keep the
                  bill pending for six months. This results in a deadlock and a
                  <b>Joint sitting</b> will be summoned by the President (under
                  Article 108).
                </li>

                    President incase of a deadlock. A deadlock is deemed to have
                    taken place under any one of the following three situations
                    after a bill (only ordinary bills or financial bills but not
                    money bills or Constitutional amendment bills) has been
                    passed by one House and transmitted to the other House:
                  </li>
                  <ul style="list-style-type: square">
                    <li>if the bill is rejected by the other House</li>
                    <li>
                      if the Houses have finally disagreed as to the amendments
                      to be made in the bill or
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      if more than six months have elapsed from the date of the
                      receipt of the bill by the other House without the bill
                      being passed by it.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <li>
                    The Speaker of Lok Sabha presides over a joint sitting of
                    the two Houses and the Deputy Speaker, in his absence.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If the bill in dispute is passed by a majority of the total
                    number of members of both the Houses present and voting in
                    the joint sitting, the bill is deemed to have been passed by
                    both the Houses and is sent for President’s assent..
                    Normally, the Lok Sabha with greater number wins the battle
                    in a joint sitting.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <h4>5. Assent of the President</h4>
              <p>
                Every bill after being passed by both Houses of Parliament
                either singly or at a joint sitting, is presented to the
                president for his assent. There are three alternatives before
                the president
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>he may give his assent to the bill; or</li>
                <li>he may withhold his assent to the bill; or</li>
                <li>
                  he may return the bill for reconsideration of the Houses.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                If the president gives his assent to the bill, the bill becomes
                an act and is placed on the Statute Book. If the President
                withholds his assent to the bill, it ends and does not become an
                act. If the President returns the bill for reconsideration and
                if it is passed by both the Houses again with or without
                amendments and presented to the President for his assent, the
                president must give his assent to the bill. Thus, the President
                enjoys only a “suspensive veto.”
              </p>
              <h3>Money Bills</h3>
              <p>
                A money bill is a bill concerned with the taxation or government
                spending (also known as appropriation of money).
                <b>Article 110</b> of the Constitution deals with the definition
                of money bills. It states that a bill is deemed to be a money
                bill if it contains ‘only’ provisions dealing with all or any of
                the following matters:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>any provision related Taxation</li>
                <li>Borrowing by the union government</li>
                <li>
                  Custody of, Payment into or withdrawal from consolidated fund
                  or contingency fund of India
                </li>
                <li>
                  the appropriation of moneys out of the consolidated Fund of
                  India
                </li>

                <li>
                  the declaring of any expenditure to be charged on the
                  Consolidated Fund of India or the increasing of the amount of
                  any such expenditure
                </li>
                <li>
                  the receipt of money on account of the Consolidated Fund of
                  India or the public account of India or the custody or issue
                  of such money or the audit of the accounts of the Union or of
                  a State; or
                </li>
                <li>
                  Any matter incidental to any of the matters specified above.
                </li>
              </ol>

              <br />

              <p>
                If any question arises whether a bill is a money bill or not,
                the <b>decision of the Speaker of the Lok Sabha is final</b>.
                When a money bill is transmitted to the Rajya Sabha for
                recommendation and presented to the president for assent, the
                Speaker endorses it as a money bill.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Constitution lays down a special procedure for the passing
                of money bills in the Parliament.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  A money bill can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha and that
                  too on the recommendation of the president. Every such bill is
                  considered to be a government bill and can be introduced only
                  by a minister.
                </li>
                <li>
                  After a money bill is passed by the Lok Sabha, it is
                  transmitted to the Rajya Sabha for its consideration. The
                  Rajya Sabha cannot reject or amend a money bill. It can only
                  make the recommendations. It must return the bill to the Lok
                  Sabha within 14 days, whether with or without recommendations.
                  The Lok Sabha can either accept or reject all or any of the
                  recommendations of the Rajya Sabha.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If the Lok Sabha accepts any recommendation, the bill is then
                  deemed to have been passed by both the Houses in the modified
                  form. If the Lok Sabha does not accept any recommendation, the
                  bill is then deemed to have passed by both the Houses in the
                  form originally passed by the Lok Sabha without any change.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If the Rajya Sabha does not return the bill to the Lok Sabha
                  within 14 days, the bill is deemed to have been passed by both
                  the Houses in the form originally passed by the Lok Sabha.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Thus, the Lok Sabha has more powers than Rajya Sabha with
                  regard to a money bill. On the other hand, both the Houses
                  have equal powers with regard to an ordinary bill.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Finally, when a money bill is presented to the president, he
                  may either give his assent to the bill or withhold his assent
                  to the bill but cannot return the bill for reconsideration of
                  the Houses. Normally, the president gives his assent to a
                  money bill as it is introduced in the Parliament with his
                  prior permission
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Financial Bills</h3>
              <p>
                Financial bills are those bills that deal with fiscal matters,
                that is, revenue or expenditure. Financial bills are of three
                kinds:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>Money bills–Article 110</li>
                <li>Financial bills (I)–Article 117 (1)</li>
                <li>Financial bills (II)–Article 117 (3)</li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                This classification implies that money bills are simply a
                species of financial bills. Hence, all money bills are financial
                bills but all financial bills are not money bills.
              </p>
              <h4>Financial Bills (I)</h4>
              <p>
                A financial bill (I) is a bill that contains not only any or all
                the matters mentioned in Article 110, but also other matters of
                general legislation. In two respects, a financial bill (I) is
                similar to a money bill–
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  both of them can be introduced only in the Lok Sabha and not
                  in the Rajya Sabha, and
                </li>
                <li>
                  both of them can be introduced only on the recommendation of
                  the president.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                In all other respects, a financial bill (I) is governed by the
                same legislative procedure applicable to an ordinary bill.
                Hence, it can be either rejected or amended by the Rajya Sabha.
                In case of a disagreement between the two Houses over such a
                bill, the president can summon a joint sitting of the two Houses
                to resolve the deadlock. When the bill is presented to the
                President, he can either give his assent to the bill or withhold
                his assent to the bill or return the bill for reconsideration of
                the Houses.
              </p>
              <h4>Financial Bills (II)</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  A financial bill (II) contains provisions involving
                  expenditure from the Consolidated Fund of India, but does not
                  include any of the matters mentioned in Article 110.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It is treated as an ordinary bill and in all respects, it is
                  governed by the same legislative procedure which is applicable
                  to an ordinary bill.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The only special feature of this bill is that it cannot be
                  passed by either House of Parliament unless the President has
                  recommended to that House the consideration of the bill.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In other words, the recommendation of the President is not
                  required at the introduction stage but is required at the
                  consideration stage.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It can be either rejected or amended by either House of
                  Parliament. In case of a disagreement between the two Houses
                  over such a bill, the President can summon a joint sitting of
                  the two Houses to resolve the deadlock.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When the bill is presented to the President, he can either
                  give his assent to the bill or withhold his assent to the bill
                  or return the bill for reconsideration of the Houses.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Budget</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                The Constitution refers to the budget as the
                <b> ‘annual financial statement’</b>. In other words, the term
                ‘budget’ has nowhere been used in the Constitution. ‘Annual
                Financial Statement’ has been dealt within
                <b> Article 112</b> of the Constitution.
              </p>
              <p>
                The budget is a statement of the estimated receipts and
                expenditure of the Government of India in a financial year,
                which begins on 1st April and ends on 31st March of the
                following year.
              </p>

              <p>
                After introduction of the Budget, the Lok Sabha discusses the
                demands for grants of various ministries and departments.
              </p>
              <p>
                All grants voted by the Lok Sabha and expenditure, charged on
                the consolidated fund of India, are then presented in the form
                of single Bill called the
                <b>‘Appropriation Bill’</b> . Proposals for taxation (to raise
                revenue) are presented in the form of <b> ‘Finance Bill’</b>.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Government of India used to have two budgets, namely, the
                Railway Budget and the General Budget. From 2017, Railway Budget
                has been merged with the General Budget on the recommendation of
                Bibek Debroy Committee.
              </p>
              <h3>Types of Funds</h3>
              <p>
                The Constitution of India provides for the following three kinds
                of funds for the Central government:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>Consolidated Fund of India (Article 266)</li>
                <li>Public Account of India (Article 266)</li>
                <li>Contingency Fund of India (Article 267)</li>
              </ol>
              <h4>Consolidated Fund of India (Article 266 (1))</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  It is a fund to which all receipts are credited and all
                  payments are debited i.e., revenues received by the government
                  and expenses made by it, are part of the Consolidated Fund.
                  Similar to the Centre, every state has its own Consolidated
                  Fund as well.
                </li>
                <li>
                  No money out of this fund can be appropriated (issued or
                  drawn) except in accordance with a Parliamentary law i.e, the
                  government needs parliamentary approval to withdraw money from
                  this fund.
                </li>
                <li>
                  There are two types of expenditure made from the Consolidated
                  Fund of India- voted and charged.
                </li>
                <ul style="list-style-type: square">
                  <li>
                    <b>Voted expenditures</b> are those which are discussed upon
                    and later voted in the parliament or legislature and later
                    becomes the budget of the country.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    On the other hand,
                    <b>charged (non-votable) expenditure</b> are those on which
                    no voting takes place. It can only be discussed by the
                    Parliament. The expenses under this category include
                    salaries and allowances of:
                  </li>
                  <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
                    <li>the President</li>
                    <li>the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker of the Lok Sabha</li>
                    <li>
                      Chairman (Vice-President) and Deputy Chairman of the Rajya
                      Sabha
                    </li>
                    <li>Supreme Court judges and High Court judges</li>

                    <li>the Comptroller and Auditor General of India</li>
                    <li>
                      the chairman and members of the Union Public Service
                      Commission.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </ul>
                <li>
                  The CAG, or the Comptroller and Auditor General, is

              <h2>Special Powers of Rajya Sabha</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                The Rajya Sabha has been given four exclusive or special powers
                that are not enjoyed by the Lok Sabha:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  It can authorize the Parliament to make a law on a subject
                  enumerated in the State List (Article 249).
                </li>
                <li>
                  It can authorize the Parliament to create new All-India
                  Services common to both the Centre and states (Article 312).
                </li>
                <li>
                  It alone can initiate a move for the removal of the
                  vice-president. In other words, a resolution for the removal
                  of the vice-president can be introduced only in the Rajya
                  Sabha and not in the Lok Sabha (Article 67).
                </li>
                <li>
                  If a proclamation is issued by the President for imposing
                  national emergency or president’s rule or financial emergency
                  at a time when the Lok Sabha has been dissolved, then the
                  proclamation can remain effective even if it is approved by
                  the Rajya Sabha alone (Articles 352, 356 and 360).
                </li>
