                Urban Local Government refers to the governance of an urban area
                by the people through their elected representatives. The
                jurisdiction of an urban local government is limited to a
                specific urban area which is demarcated for this purpose by the
                state government.

                The system of urban government was constitutionalized through
                the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act of 1992. At the Central
                level, the subject of ‘urban local government’ is dealt with by
                the following three ministries:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs.</li>
                <li>Ministry of Defense in the case of cantonment boards</li>
                <li>
                  Ministry of Home Affairs in the case of Union Territories
                </li>
              </ol>

              <h2>74th Amendment Act of 1992</h2>
              <p>
                This Act has added a new Part IX-A to the Constitution of India.
                This part is entitled as ‘The Municipalities’ and consists of
                provisions from Articles 243-P to 243-ZG. In addition, the act
                has also added a new Twelfth Schedule to the Constitution. This
                schedule contains eighteen functional items of municipalities.
                It deals with Article 243-W.
              </p>
              <p>
                The act gave constitutional status to the municipalities. It has
                brought them under the purview of justiciable part of the
                Constitution. In other words, state governments are under
                constitutional obligation to adopt the new system of
                municipalities in accordance with the provisions of the act. The
                act aims at revitalizing and strengthening the urban governments
                so that they function effectively as units of local government.

              <h3>History of Constitutionalisation</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  In August 1989, the Rajiv Gandhi government introduced the
                  65th Constitutional Amendment Bill (i.e., Nagarpalika Bill) in
                  the Lok Sabha aimed at strengthening and revamping the
                  municipal bodies by conferring a constitutional status on
                  them. Although the bill was passed in the Lok Sabha, it was
                  defeated in the Rajya Sabha in October 1989 and hence, lapsed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The National Front Government under V P Singh introduced the
                  revised Nagarpalika Bill in the Lok Sabha again in September
                  1990. However, the bill was not passed and finally lapsed due
                  to the dissolution of the Lok Sabha.
                </li>
                <li>
                  P V Narasimha Rao’s Government also introduced the modified
                  Municipalities Bill inthe Lok Sabha in September 1991. It
                  finally emerged as the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act of
                  1992 and came into force on 1 June 1993.

              <h3>Municipal Corporation</h3>
              <p>
                Municipal corporations are created for the administration of big
                cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Bangalore and
                others. A municipal corporation has three authorities:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <b>the council:</b> the deliberative and legislative wing of
                  the corporation. It consists of the councilors directly
                  elected by the people. It is headed by a <b> Mayor</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b> the standing committees:</b> created to facilitate the
                  working of the council, which is too large in size. They deal
                  with public works, education, health, taxation, finance and so
                  on.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>the municipal commissioner:</b> responsible for the
                  implementation of the decisions taken by the council and its
                  standing committees. He is appointed by the state government
                  and is generally a member of the IAS.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <h3>Municipality</h3>
              <p>
                The municipalities are established for the administration of
                towns and smaller cities. They are known by various other names
                like municipal council, municipal committee, municipal board,
                borough municipality, city municipality and others. A
                municipality also has three authorities:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <b>The council</b> is the deliberative and legislative wing of
                  the municipality. It consists of the councilors directly
                  elected by the people. The council is headed by a
                  <b> president/chairman</b>. He is assisted by a
                  vice-president/vice-chairman.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b> The standing committees</b> are created to facilitate the
                  working of the council. They deal with public works, taxation,
                  health, finance and so on.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>The chief executive officer/chief municipal officer</b> is
                  responsible for day-to-day general administration of the
                  municipality. He is appointed by the state government.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <h3>Notified Area Committee</h3>
              <p>
                A notified area committee is created for the administration of
                two types of areas–
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>a fast developing town due to industrialization, and</li>
                <li>
                  a town which does not yet fulfil all the conditions necessary
                  for the constitution of a municipality, but which otherwise is
                  considered important by the state government.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                Its powers are almost equivalent to those of a municipality. But
                unlike the municipality, it is an entirely nominated body, that
                is, all the members of a notified area committee including the
                chairman are nominated by the state government.
              </p>
              <h3>Town Area Committee</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  A town area committee is set up for the administration of a
                  small town.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It is a semi municipal authority and is entrusted with a
                  limited number of civic functions like drainage, roads, street
                  lighting, and conservancy.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It may be wholly elected or wholly nominated by the state
                  government or partly elected and partly nominated.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Cantonment Board</h3>
              <p>
                A cantonment board is established for municipal administration
                for civilian population in the cantonment area. It works under
                the administrative control of the defence ministry of the
                Central government.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Note:</b> The above four types of urban local bodies are
                created and administered by the state government, a cantonment
                board is created as well as administered by the Central
                government.
              </p>
              <p>
                A cantonment board consists of partly elected and partly
                nominated members. The military officer commanding the station
                is the ex-officio president of the board and presides over its
                meetings.
              </p>
              <p>
                The executive officer of the cantonment board is appointed by
                the president of India. He implements all the resolutions and
                decisions of the board and its committees.
              </p>
              <h3>Township</h3>
              <p>
                This type of urban government is established by the large public
                enterprises to provide civic amenities to its staff and workers
                who live in the housing colonies built near the plant.
              </p>
              <p>
                The township form of urban government has no elected members.
              </p>
              <h3>Port Trust</h3>
              <p>
                The port trusts are established in the port areas like Mumbai,
                Kolkata, Chennai and so on for two purposes: (a) to manage and
                protect the ports; and (b) to provide civic amenities.
              </p>
              <p>
                Aport trust is created by an Act of Parliament. It consists of
                both elected and nominated members.
              </p>
              <h3>Special Purpose Agency</h3>
              <p>
                In addition to these seven area-based urban bodies (or
                multipurpose agencies), the states have set up certain agencies
                to undertake designated activities or specific functions that
                ‘legitimately’ belong to the domain of municipal corporations or
                municipalities or other local urban governments. In other words,
                these are function-based and not area-based.
