                  The framers of our Constitution have borrowed these principles
                  from the
                  <b>Irish Constitution</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Dr BR Ambedkar, described these principles as
                  <b> novel feature</b> of the Constitution.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Granville Austin has described the Directive Principles and
                  the Fundamental Rights as the
                  <b>‘Conscience of the Constitution’</b> .
                </li>

                <li>
                  These principles are <b>not justiciable</b>, it means that
                  there is no legal force behind these principles. But they are
                  fundamental in the governance of the country.
                </li>

                <li>
                  In the <b>Minerva Mills case (1980)</b>, the Supreme Court
                  held that ‘the Indian Constitution is founded on the bedrock
                  of the balance between the Fundamental Rights and the
                  Directive Principles.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Parliament can amend the Fundamental Rights for
                  implementing the Directive Principles, as long as the
                  amendment does not damage or destroy the basic structure of
                  the Constitution.

                The Constitution does not contain any classification of
                Directive Principles. However, on the basis of their content and
                direction, they can be classified into three broad categories:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Socialist Principles</li>
