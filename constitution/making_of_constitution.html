                    On 3 June 1947 Lord Mountbatten, the last British

                  The members of the Muslim League from the Indian Dominion also
                  entered the Assembly. The Muslim League members hailing from

                <li>
                  The Assembly was made a successor to the British parliament's

                  words, two separate functions were assigned to the Assembly,
                  that is, making of the Constitution for free India and
                  enacting of ordinary laws for the country. Thus, the Assembly
                  became the <b>first Parliament of free India</b>.

                  January 26 was specifically chosen as the ‘date of
                  commencement’ of the Constitution because of its historical
                  importance. It was on this day in 1930 that
                  <b>Purna Swaraj day</b> was celebrated, following the
                  resolution of the <b>Lahore Session</b> (December 1929) of the
                  INC.

              <h2>Critism of the Constituent Assembly</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The Constituent Assembly was called a
                  <b>non-representative body</b>
                  , since its members were not directly elected by the people of
                  India on the basis of universal adult franchise, , but rather,
                  they were predominantly members of the <b>Congress party</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Constituent Assembly was called a
                  <b>non-Sovereign body</b>, since it was created by the
                  proposals of the British Government and held its sessions with
                  the permission of the British Government.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Constituent Assembly was criticised for taking
                  <b>unduly long time</b> to make the Constitution. In this
                  context, <b>Naziruddin Ahmed</b> , a member of the Constituent
                  Assembly, coined a new name for the Drafting Committee to show
                  his contempt for it. He called it a
                  <b>“Drifting Committee”</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The critics argued that the Constituent Assembly was
                  <b>dominated by lawyers and politicians</b> . and the other
                  sections of the society were not sufficiently represented.
                  This, to them, is the main reason for the bulkiness and
                  complicated language of the Constitution.
