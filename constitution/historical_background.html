              <h3>Government of India Act, 1935</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  An <b>all-India Federation</b> was proposed which would
                  consist of British India and the princely states. This
                  federation never came into being as the princely states did
                  not join it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Act divided the powers between the Centre and the units
                  into
                  <b>three lists</b>, namely the <b>Federal List</b> (59 items),
                  the <b>Provincial List</b> (54 items) and the
                  <b>Concurrent List</b> (36 items). Residuary (remaining)
                  powers were given to the Viceroy.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Act <b>abolished the Dyarchy</b> in the Provinces and
                  introduced <b>‘Provincial Autonomy’</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The act tried introducing Dyarchy at the Centre but it never
                  came into effect.
                </li>
                <li>

                  provinces were Assam, Bengal, Bombay, Bihar, Madras and the
                  United Province.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It <b>abolished the Council of India</b>, established by the
                  Government of India Act of 1858.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It provided for the establishment of a
                  <b>Reserve Bank of India</b> as the Central Bank of India.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It provided for the establishment of
                  <b>Federal Court</b>(1937) which was replaced by the Supreme
                  Court of India on 28 January 1950.
                </li>
                <li>
                  This Act continued until it was replaced by the new Indian
                  Constitution.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Indian Independence Act of 1947</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  India was declared <b>independent</b> and <b>sovereign</b>.
                  India was partitioned into two independent dominions of India
                  and Pakistan.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It granted freedom to the Indian princely states either to
                  join the Dominion of India or Dominion of Pakistan or to
                  remain independent.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The office of the <b>Secretary of State</b> for India was
                  <b>abolished</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The <b>Viceroy and the Governors</b> were made
                  <b>constitutional (nominal) heads</b>. They were made to act
                  on the advice of the respective council of ministers in all
                  matters.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It empowered the Constituent Assemblies of the two dominions
                  to frame and adopt any constitution for their respective
                  nations.
                </li>
                <li>

                  Constituent Assembly until new elections were conducted.
