              <h1 class="title">Chief Minister</h1>
              <p>
                In case of a State in India, the governor is the nominal
                executive authority (de jure executive) and the Chief Minister
                is the real executive authority (de facto executive).
              </p>
              <p>
                In other words, the governor is the head of the state while the
                Chief Minister is the head of the government. Thus, the position
                of the Chief Minister at the state level is analogous to the
                position of prime minister at the Centre.
              </p>

              <h3>Appointment</h3>
              <p>
                The Constitution does not contain any specific procedure for the
                selection and appointment of the Chief Minister. Article 164
                only says that the Chief Minister shall be appointed by the
                governor.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, this does not imply that the governor is free to
                appoint any one as the Chief Minister. In accordance with the
                conventions of the parliamentary system of government:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The governor has to appoint the leader of the majority party
                  in the state legislative assembly as the Chief Minister.
                </li>
                <li>
                  But, when no party has a clear majority in the assembly, then
                  the governor may exercise his personal discretion in the
                  selection and appointment of the Chief Minister. In such a
                  situation, the governor usually appoints the leader of the
                  largest party or coalition in the assembly as the Chief
                  Minister and ask him to seek a vote of confidence in the House
                  within a month.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The governor may have to exercise his individual judgement in
                  the selection and appointed of the Chief Minister when the
                  Chief Minister in office dies suddenly and there is no obvious
                  successor. However, on the death of a Chief Minister, the
                  ruling party usually elects a new leader and the governor has
                  no choice but to appoint him as Chief Minister.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Constitution does not require that a person must prove his
                  majority in the legislative assembly before he is appointed as
                  the Chief Minister. The governor may first appoint him as the
                  Chief Minister and then ask him to prove his majority in the
                  legislative assembly within a reasonable period.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A person who is not a member of the state legislature can be
                  appointed as Chief Minister for six months, within which time,
                  he should be elected to the state legislature, failing which
                  he ceases to be the Chief Minister.
                </li>
                <li>
                  According to the Constitution, the Chief Minister may be a
                  member of any of the two Houses of a state legislature.
                  Usually, Chief Ministers have been selected from the Lower
                  House (legislative assembly).
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Oath</h3>
              <p>
                Before the Chief Minister enters his office, the governor
                administers to him the oaths of office and secrecy.
              </p>
              <p><b> In his oath of office, the Chief Minister swears:</b></p>
              <p>
                "I (name) do swear in the name of God (or solemnly affirm) that
                I will bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of
                India as by law established, that I will uphold the sovereignty
                and integrity of India, that I will faithfully and
                conscientiously discharge my duties as a Minister for the State
                of and that I will do right to all manner of people in
                accordance with the Constitution and the law without fear or
                favour, affection or ill-will. "
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>In his oath of secrecy, the Chief Minister swears:</b>
              </p>
              <p>
                "I, (name), do swear in the name of God (or solemnly affirm)
                that I will not directly or indirectly communicate or reveal to
                any person or persons any matter which shall be brought under my
                consideration or shall become known to me as a Minister for the
                State of (name of the state) except as may be required for the
                due discharge of my duties as such Minister."
              </p>

              <h3>Term</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The term of the Chief Minister is not fixed and he holds
                  office during the pleasure of the governor.
                </li>
                <li>
                  However, this does not mean that the governor can dismiss him
                  at any time. He cannot be dismissed by the governor as long as
                  he enjoys the majority support in the legislative assembly.
                </li>
                <li>
                  But, if he loses the confidence (fails no-confidence motion)
                  of the assembly, he must resign or the governor can dismiss
                  him.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The salary and allowances of the Chief Minister are determined
                by the state legislature.
              </p>
