                  <b>Judicial Committee of the Privy Council</b> which were then
                  at the apex of the Indian court system.

                <li>
                  The Chief Justice of India (CJI) is the head and chief judge
                  of the Supreme Court. It consists of a maximum of 34 judges
                  (including the Chief Justice of India).
                </li>
                <li>Apart from the above mentioned judges:</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    the President may appoint an <b>Acting Chief Justice</b> in
                    case the office of CJI is vacant or incase CJI is
                    absent/unable to perform the duties.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    the CJI can appoint a judge of a High Court as an
                    <b>ad hoc (temporary) judge</b> incase of lack of quorum in
                    the Supreme Court.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    the CJI can request a <b>retired judge</b> of the Supreme
                    Court or a qualified retired judge of a high court to act as
                    a judge of the Supreme Court for a temporary period.

              <h3>Appointment of Judges</h3>

              <p>
                A judge is appointed to the Supreme Court by the president on
                the recommendation of the <b>collegium</b>- a closed group of
                the Chief Justice of India, the four most senior judges of the
                court and the senior-most judge hailing from the high court of a
                prospective appointee.
              </p>

              <h3>Appointment of Cheif Justice</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The chief justice is appointed by the president after
                  consultation with such judges of the Supreme Court and high
                  courts as he deems necessary.
                </li>
                <li>
                  From 1950 to 1973, the practice has been to appoint the senior
                  most judge of the Supreme Court as the chief justice of India.
                  This established convention was violated in 1973 when A.N. Ray
                  was appointed as the Chief Justice of India by superseding
                  three senior judges.
                </li>
                <li>
                  This discretion of the government was curtailed by the Supreme
                  Court in the <b>Second Judges Case</b> (1993), in which the
                  Supreme Court ruled that the senior most judge of the Supreme
                  Court should alone be appointed to the office of the chief
                  justice of India.

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    The collegium system has come under a fair amount of
                    criticism. In 2015, the parliament passed a law to replace
                    the collegium with a National Judicial Appointments
                    Commission (NJAC) (99th Constitutional Amendment Act of 2014
                    and the National Judicial Appointments Commission Act of
                    2014).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    However, in the fourth judges case (2015), the Supreme Court
                    has declared both the 99th Constitutional Amendment as well
                    as the NJAC Act as unconstitutional and void as the court
                    opined that the new system (NJAC) would affect the
                    independence of the judiciary.

              <h2>Oath or Affirmation</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                A person appointed as a judge of the Supreme Court, before
                entering upon his Office, has to make and subscribe an oath or
                affirmation before the President, or some person appointed by
                him for this purpose. In his oath, a judge of the Supreme Court
                swears:
              </p>
              <p>
                "... will bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of

                the best of my ability, knowledge and judgement perform the
                duties of my office without fear or favour, affection or
                ill-will and that I will uphold the Constitution and the laws."
              </p>
              <h2>Tenure</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                The Constitution has not fixed the tenure of a judge of the
                Supreme Court. However, it makes the following three provisions
                in this regard:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>He holds office until he attains the age of 65 years.</li>
                <li>He can resign his office by writing to the president.</li>
                <li>
                  He can be removed from his office by the President on the
                  recommendation of the Parliament.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3 id="removal_of_judge">Removal of Judges</h3>
              <p>
                President can remove a judge on proved <b>misbehaviour</b> or
                <b>incapacity</b> when parliament approves with a
                <b>special majority</b> of each House of Parliament (i.e., a
                majority of the total membership of that House and a majority of
                not less than two-thirds of the members of that House present
                and voting).
              </p>

              <h3>Procedure for Removal</h3>
              <p>
                The Judges (Inquiry) Act, 1968 regulates the procedure relating
                to the removal of a judge of the Supreme Court by the process of
                impeachment:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  A removal motion signed by 100 members (in the case of Lok
                  Sabha) or 50 members (in the case of Rajya Sabha) is to be
                  given to the Speaker/ Chairman.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Speaker/Chairman may admit the motion or refuse to admit
                  it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If it is admitted, then the Speaker/ Chairman is to constitute
                  a three-member committee to investigate into the charges.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The committee should consist of (a) the chief justice or a
                  judge of the Supreme Court, (b) a chief justice of a high
                  court, and (c) a distinguished jurist.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If the committee finds the judge to be guilty of misbehavior
                  or suffering from an incapacity, the House can take up the
                  consideration of the motion.
                </li>
                <li>
                  After the motion is passed by each House of Parliament by
                  special majority, an address is presented to the president for
                  removal of the judge.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Finally, the president passes an order removing the judge.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                <b>Note:</b> No judge of the Supreme Court has been impeached so
                far.
              </p>

              <h2>Independence of Supreme Court</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                The Constitution has made the following provisions to safeguard
                and ensure the independent and impartial functioning of the
                Supreme Court:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Mode of Appointment</b>: The judges of the Supreme Court
                  are appointed by the President in consultation with the
                  members of the judiciary itself (i.e., judges of the Supreme
                  Court and the high courts).
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b> Security of Tenure</b>: The judges of the Supreme Court
                  can be removed from office by the President only in the manner
                  and on the grounds mentioned in the Constitution. This means
                  that they do not hold their office during the pleasure of the
                  President, though they are appointed by him.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b> Fixed Service Conditions</b>: The salaries, allowances,
                  privileges, leave and pension of the judges of the Supreme
                  Court are determined from time to time by the Parliament. They
                  cannot be changed to their disadvantage after their
                  appointment except during a financial emergency.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Expenses Charged on Consolidated Fund</b>: The salaries,
                  allowances and pensions of the judges and the staff as well as
                  all the administrative expenses of the Supreme Court are
                  charged on the Consolidated Fund of India. Thus, they are
                  non-votable by the Parliament.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Conduct of Judges cannot be Discussed</b>: The Constitution
                  prohibits any discussion in Parliament or in a State
                  Legislature with respect to the conduct of the judges of the
                  Supreme Court in the discharge of their duties, except when an
                  impeachment motion is under consideration of the Parliament
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Ban on Practice after Retirement</b>: The retired judges of
                  the Supreme Court are prohibited from pleading or acting in
                  any Court or before any authority within the territory of
                  India. This "ensures" that they do not favor anyone in the
                  hope of future favor.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b> Power to Punish for its Contempt</b>: The Supreme Court
                  can punish any person for its contempt. Thus, its actions and
                  decisions cannot be criticized and opposed by anybody.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Freedom to Appoint its Staff</b>: The Chief Justice of
                  India can appoint officers and servants of the Supreme Court
                  without any interference from the executive. He can also
                  prescribe their conditions of service.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b> Its Jurisdiction cannot be Curtailed:</b> The Parliament
                  is not authorized to curtail the jurisdiction and powers of
                  the Supreme Court. The Constitution has guaranteed to the
                  Supreme Court, jurisdiction of various kinds. However, the
                  Parliament can extend the same.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b> Separation from Executive (Article 50):</b> The
                  Constitution directs the State to take steps to separate the
                  Judiciary from the Executive in the public services. This
                  means that the executive authorities should not possess the
                  judicial powers.

              </ul>
              <h2>Jurisdiction and Powers of Supreme Court</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <h3>Original and Exclusive Jurisdiction</h3>
              <p>
                As a federal court, the Supreme Court decides the disputes
                between different units of the Indian Federation. More
                elaborately, any dispute:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Between the Centre and one or more states or</li>
                <li>Between two or more states.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                In the above <b>federal disputes</b>, the Supreme Court has
                <b> exclusive original jurisdiction</b>. Exclusive means, no
                other court can decide such disputes and original means, the
                power to hear such disputes in the first instance, not by way of
                appeal.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b> Note:</b> any suit brought before the Supreme Court by a
                private citizen against the Centre or a state cannot be
                entertained under this.
              </p>
              <h3>Writ Jurisdiction</h3>
              <p>
                The Supreme Court is empowered to issue writs including habeas
                corpus, mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto and certiorari for
                the enforcement of the fundamental rights of an aggrieved
                citizen.
              </p>
              <p>
                In this regard, the Supreme Court has
                <b>original jurisdiction</b> in the sense that an aggrieved
                citizen can directly go to the Supreme Court, not necessarily by
                way of appeal.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, the writ jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is
                <b> not exclusive</b>. The high courts are also empowered to
                issue writs for the enforcement of the Fundamental Rights. It
                means, when the Fundamental Rights of a citizen are violated,
                the aggrieved party has the option of moving either the high
                court or the Supreme Court directly.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Note:</b> any suit brought before the Supreme Court by a
                private citizen against the Centre or a state can be entertained
                under this.
              </p>
              <h3>Appellate Jurisdiction</h3>
              <p>
                The Supreme Court is primarily a court of appeal and hears
                appeals against the judgements of the lower courts. It can
                review, amend and overrule decisions of a lower court.
              </p>
              <h3>Advisory Jurisdiction</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The Constitution (Article 143) authorizes the president to
                  seek the opinion of the Supreme Court in the two categories of
                  matters:
                </li>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    On any question of law or fact of public importance which
                    has arisen or which is likely to arise.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    On any dispute arising out of any pre-constitution treaty,
                    agreement, covenant, engagement, sanad or other similar
                    instruments.
                  </li>
                </ol>
                <li>
                  In the first case, the Supreme Court may tender or may refuse
                  to tender its opinion to the president. But, in the second
                  case, the Supreme Court ‘must’ tender its opinion to the
                  president. In both the cases, the opinion expressed by the
                  Supreme Court is only advisory and not a judicial
                  pronouncement. Hence, it is not binding on the president; he
                  may follow or may not follow the opinion.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>A Court of Record</h3>
              <p>As a Court of Record, the Supreme Court has two powers:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The judgements, proceedings and acts of the Supreme Court are
                  recorded for perpetual memory and testimony.
                </li>
                <li>It has power to punish for contempt of court.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                In 1991, the Supreme Court has ruled that it has power to punish
                for contempt not only of itself but also of high courts,
                subordinate courts and tribunals functioning in the entire
                country. Contempt of court may be civil or criminal.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b> Civil contempt</b> means willful disobedience to any
                  judgement, order, writ or other process of a court or willful
                  breach of an undertaking given to a court.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Criminal contempt</b> means the publication of any matter
                  or doing an act which–(i) scandalizes or lowers the authority
                  of a court; or (ii) prejudices or interferes with the due
                  course of a judicial proceeding; or (iii) interferes or
                  obstructs the administration of justice in any other manner.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                However, innocent publication and distribution of some matter,
                fair and accurate report of judicial proceedings, fair and
                reasonable criticism of judicial acts and comment on the
                administrative side of the judiciary do not amount to contempt
                of court.
              </p>
              <h3>Constitutional Interpretation</h3>
              <p>
                The Supreme Court is the ultimate interpreter of the
                Constitution. It can give final version to the spirit and
                content of the provisions of the constitution and the verbiage
                used in the constitution.
              </p>
              <h3>Other Powers</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  It decides the disputes regarding the election of the
                  president and the vice-president. In this regard, it has the
                  original, exclusive and final authority.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It enquires into the conduct and behavior of the chairman and
                  members of the Union Public Service Commission and any State
                  Public Service Commission on a reference made by the
                  president. If it finds them guilty of misbehavior, it can
                  recommend to the president for their removal. The advice
                  tendered by the Supreme Court in this regard is binding on the
                  President.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It has power to review its own judgement or order. Thus, it is
                  not bound by its previous decision and can depart from it in
                  the interest of justice or community welfare. In brief, the
                  Supreme Court is a self-correcting agency.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It is authorized to withdraw the cases pending before the high
                  courts and dispose them by itself. It can also transfer a case
                  or appeal pending before one high court to another high court.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Its law is binding on all courts in India. Its decree or order
                  is enforceable throughout the country. All authorities (civil
                  and judicial) in the country should act in aid of the Supreme
                  Court.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It has power of judicial superintendence and control over all
                  the courts and tribunals functioning in the entire territory
                  of the country.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h2>Judicial Review</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                Judicial review is the power of the Supreme Court to examine the
                constitutionality of legislative enactments and executive orders
                of both the Central and state governments. On examination, if
                they are found to be violative of the Constitution or
                ultra-vires (latin for "beyond the powers"), they can be
                declared as illegal, unconstitutional and invalid (null and
                void) by the Supreme Court. Consequently, they cannot be
                enforced by the Government.
              </p>
              <p>
                Judicial review is one of the checks and balances in the
                separation of powers.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Supreme Court has declared the power of judicial review as a
                basic feature of the Constitution or an element of the basic
                structure of the Constitution. Hence, the power of judicial
                review cannot be curtailed or excluded even by a constitutional
                amendment.
              </p>
              <p>
                Judicial review is classified into following three categories:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>Judicial review of constitutional amendments.</li>
                <li>
                  Judicial review of legislation of the Parliament and State
                  Legislatures and subordinate legislations.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Judicial review of administrative action of the Union and
                  State and authorities under the state.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                <b>Importance:</b> Judicial review is needed for the following
                reasons:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  To uphold the principle of the supremacy of the Constitution.
                </li>
                <li>
                  To maintain federal equilibrium (balance between the Centre
                  and the states).
                </li>
                <li>To protect the Fundamental Rights of the citizens</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                <b>Scope of Judicial Review:</b> The constitutional validity of
                a legislative enactment or an executive order can be challenged
                in the Supreme Court or in the High Courts on the following
                three grounds.
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>if it infringes the Fundamental Rights (Part III),</li>
                <li>
                  if it is outside the competence of the authority which has
                  framed it (ultra-vires), and
                </li>
                <li>if it is violative of the constitutional provisions.</li>
              </ol>
              <p><b>Judicial Review of the Ninth Schedule</b></p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Article 31B saves the acts and regulations included in the
                  Ninth Schedule from being challenged and invalidated on the
                  ground of contravention of any of the Fundamental Rights.
                  Article 31B along with the Ninth Schedule was added by the 1st
                  Constitutional Amendment Act of 1951.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Originally (in 1951), the Ninth Schedule contained only 13
                  acts and regulations but at present (in 2016) their number is
                  282. Of these, the acts and regulations of the state
                  legislature deal with land reforms and abolition of the
                  zamindari system and that of the Parliament deal with other
                  matters.
                </li>
                <li>
                  However, in a significant judgement delivered in
                  <b> I.R. Coelho case</b>
                  (2007), the Supreme Court ruled that there could not be any
                  blanket immunity from judicial review of laws included in the
                  Ninth Schedule. The court held that judicial review is a
                  ‘basic feature’ of the constitution and it could not be taken
                  away by putting a law under the Ninth Schedule. It said that
                  the laws placed under the Ninth Schedule after April 24, 1973,
                  are open to challenge in court if they violated Fundamental
                  Rights guaranteed under the Articles 14, 15, 19 and 21 or the
                  ‘basic structure’ of the Constitution. It was on April 24,
                  1973, that the Supreme Court first propounded the doctrine of
                  ‘basic structure’ or ‘basic features’ of the constitution in
                  its landmark verdict in the Kesavananda Bharati case.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h2>Judicial Activism</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                Judicial activism denotes the proactive role played by the
                judiciary in the protection of the rights of citizens and in the
                promotion of justice in the society. In other words, it implies
                the assertive role played by the judiciary to force the other
                two organs of the government (legislature and executive) to
                discharge their constitutional duties.
              </p>
              <p>There are various methods of judicial activism:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Suo Moto</li>
                <li>Judicial review</li>
                <li>Public Interest Litigation (PIL)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Suo Moto is a latin term meaning <b>"on its own"</b>. It is a
                special power of High Courts and the Supreme court of India and
                other equivalent quasi judicial bodies like Human Rights
                Commission etc. to initiate a hearing by itself without any
                appeal or petition or PIL. When court feels that a matter
                requires serious and immediate legal intervention, it acts Suo
                Motu.
              </p>
              <p>
                The concept of judicial activism is closely related to the
                concept of Public Interest Litigation (PIL). It is the judicial
                activism of the Supreme Court which is the major factor for the
                rise of PIL. In other words, PIL is an outcome of judicial
                activism. In fact, PIL is the most popular form (or
                manifestation) of judicial activism
              </p>
              <h3>Public Interest Litigation</h3>
              <p>
                Normally only that person whose rights are infringed alone can
                move the court for the remedies. This traditional rule is called
                <b>‘locus standi’</b> . PIL is an exception or a relaxation to
                this traditional rule.
              </p>
              <p>
                Under PIL, any public-spirited citizen or a social organization
                can move the court for the enforcement of the rights of any
                person or group of persons who because of their poverty or
                ignorance or socially or economically disadvantaged position are
                themselves unable to approach the court for the remedies.
              </p>
              <p>
                Also, any matter where the interest of the public at large is
                affected (such as Pollution, Terrorism, Road safety,
                Constructional hazards, etc.) can be redressed by filing a
                Public Interest Litigation in a court of law.
              </p>

              <p>
                Justice V.R. Krishna Iyer and Justice P.N. Bhagwati were the
                pioneers of the concept of PIL in India.
