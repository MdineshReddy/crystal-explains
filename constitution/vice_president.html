              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>He should be a citizen of India.</li>
                <li>He should have completed 35 years of age.</li>
                <li>
                  He should be qualified for election as a member of the Rajya
                  Sabha (Representation of the People Act, 1951).
                </li>
                <li>
                  He should not hold any office of profit under the Union
                  government or any state government or any local authority or
                  any other public authority.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                Further, the nomination of a candidate for election to the
                office of Vice-President must be supported by at least 20
                electors as proposers and 20 electors as seconders. Every
                candidate has to make a security deposit of ₹15,000 in the
                Reserve Bank of India.
              </p>
              <h2>Election (Article 66)</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                The Vice-President, like the president, is elected not directly
                by the people but by the method of indirect election. He is
                elected by the members of an electoral college consisting of the
                members of both Houses of Parliament.
              </p>
              <p>
                Thus, this electoral college is different from the electoral
                college for the election of the President in the following two
                respects:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  It consists of both elected and nominated members of the
                  Parliament (in the case of president, only elected members).
                </li>
                <li>
                  It does not include the members of the state legislative
                  assemblies (in the case of President, the elected members of
                  the state legislative assemblies are included).
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                But, the manner of election is same in both the cases. Thus, the
                Vice-President’s election, like that of the President’s
                election, is held in accordance with
                <b>
                  the system of proportional representation by means of the
                  single transferable vote and the voting is by secret ballot</b
                >.
              </p>
              <p>
                Under Article 71, all doubts and disputes in connection with
                election of the Vice-President are inquired into and decided by
                the Supreme Court whose decision is final.
              </p>
              <h2>Oath or Affirmation by the Vice-President (Article 69)</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                Under <b> Article 69</b>, the oath of office of the
                Vice-President is administered by the <b>President</b> or some
                person appointed in that behalf by him. In his oath, the
                Vice-President swears:
              </p>
              <p>
                "I, [name] do swear in the name of God/solemnly affirm that I
                will bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of India
                as by law established and that I will faithfully discharge the
                duty upon which I am about to enter."
              </p>
              <h2>Conditions of Office</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                The Constitution lays down the following two conditions of the
                Vice-President’s office:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  He should not be a member of either House of Parliament or a
                  House of the state legislature. If any such person is elected
                  Vice-President, he is deemed to have vacated his seat in that
                  House on the date on which he enters upon his office as
                  Vice-President.
                </li>
                <li>He should not hold any other office of profit.</li>
              </ul>
              <h2>Term, Removal and Vacany of Office (Article 67 & 68)</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <h3>Term of the office</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The Vice President shall hold office for a term of five years
                  from the date on which he enters upon his office.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He can resign from his office at any time by addressing the
                  resignation letter to the President.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He can be removed by a resolution of the Rajya Sabha or by the
                  Supreme Court.
                </li>

                <li>He can be elected for any number of terms.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Removal</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  A formal impeachment is not required for his removal. He can
                  be removed by a resolution of the Rajya Sabha passed by an
                  <b>effective majority</b> (i.e.,majority of all the then
                  member of the house) and agreed by the Lok Sabha with simple
                  majority[Article 67(b)]. But a 14 day's advance notice has to
                  be given to the Vice President before moving such a
                  resolution.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Under Article 71, he can also be removed by the Supreme Court
                  in case of electoral malpractices or upon being not eligible
                  to be Rajya Sabha member under the Representation of the
                  People Act, 1951.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>No Vice President has ever faced removal.</p>
              <h3>Vacancy in Office</h3>
              <p>
                A vacancy in the Vice-President’s office can occur in any of the
                following ways:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>On the expiry of his tenure of five years.</li>
                <li>By his resignation.</li>
                <li>On his removal.</li>
                <li>By his death.</li>
                <li>
                  Otherwise, for example, when he becomes disqualified to hold
                  office or when his election is declared void.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                When the vacancy is going to be caused by the expiration of the
                term of the sitting vicepresident, an election to fill the
                vacancy must be held before the expiration of the term.
              </p>
              <p>
                If the office falls vacant by resignation, removal, death or
                otherwise, then election to fill the vacancy should be held as
                soon as possible after the occurrence of the vacancy. The newly
                elected vice-president remains in office for a full term of five
                years from the date he assumes charge of his office.
              </p>
              <h2>Powers and Functions</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>

                <li>
                  He acts as the ex-officio Chairman of Rajya Sabha. In this
                  capacity, his powers and functions are similar to those of the

                </li>
                <li>

                  While acting as President or discharging the functions of
                  President, the Vice-President does not perform the duties of
                  the office of Chairman of Rajya Sabha, those duties are
                  performed by the Deputy Chairman of Rajya Sabha.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If the offices of both the President and the Vice-President
                  fall vacant by reason of death, resignation, removal etc., the
                  Chief Justice of India or in his absence the senior most judge
                  of the Supreme Court acts as President.
                </li>
                <ul style="list-style-type: square">
                  <li>
                    For the first time in 1969, when the President Dr Zakir
                    Hussain died and the Vice-President V V Giri resigned, the
                    Chief Justice M Hidayatullah acted as President.
