                  ‘Union of States’ has been preferred to ‘Federation of States’

                  According to Article 1, the territory of India can be
                  classified into three categories:

                  <li>Territories of the states</li>

                    Territories that may be acquired by the Government of India

                  The names of states and union territories and their

                  <b>first schedule</b> of the Constitution. At present (2021),
                  there are 28 states and 8 union territories.

                <li>
                  The term ‘Territory of India’ is a wider expression than the
                  ‘Union of India’ because the latter includes only states while
                  the former includes not only the states, but also union
                  territories and territories that may be acquired by the
                  Government of India at any future time.

                <li>Article 3 authorises the Parliament to:</li>

                  However, Article 3 lays down two conditions in this regard:

                <ul style="list-style-type: square">
                  <li>
                    a bill regarding the above changes (states reorganisation
                    bill) can be introduced in the Parliament only with the
                    <b>prior recommendation of the President.</b>

                  <li>
                    before recommending the bill, the President has to refer the
                    same to the state legislature concerned for expressing its
                    views within a specified period.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <li>
                  However, the president is not bound by the views of the state
                  legislature and may either accept or reject them, even if the
                  views are received in time. In case of a union territory, no
                  reference need be made to the concerned legislature to
                  ascertain its views and the Parliament can itself take any

                  Hence, the territorial integrity or continued existence of any
                  state is not guaranteed by the Constitution. Therefore, India
                  is rightly described as

                  The decision of the Central Government to cede part of a
                  territory known as <b>Berubari Union</b> (West Bengal) to
                  Pakistan (Now Bangladesh) led to political agitation and
                  controversy and thereby necessitated the Presidential
                  reference.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Supreme Court held that the power of Parliament to
                  diminish the area of a state (under Article 3)
                  <b>does not cover cession</b> of Indian territory to a foreign

                  <li>
                    The 100th Constitutional Amendment Act (2015) was enacted to
                    give effect to the acquiring of certain territories by India
                    and transfer of certain other territories to Bangladesh.
                    Under this deal, India transferred 111 enclaves to

                  The Indian Independence Act of 1947 granted freedom to the
                  princely states either to join the Dominion of India or
                  Dominion of Pakistan or to remain independent.

                  Of the 552 princely states situated within the geographical
                  boundaries of India, 549 joined India and the remaining 3
                  (Hyderabad, Junagarh and Kashmir) refused to join India.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Eventually, they were also integrated with India–Hyderabad by

                  The Constituent Assembly appointed the SK Dhar Commission in
                  June 1948, to study the feasibility of the reorganisation of
                  the states on linguistic basis.

                <li>
                  It was felt that such reorganisation would fuel regional
                  sentiments and might threaten national integration which was
                  precarious in the background of Partition.
                </li>

                    In October 1953, the Government of India was forced to
                    create the First Linguistic State, <b>Andhra State</b>, by
                    separating the Telugu speaking area from Madras Presidency
                    after the death of <b>Potti Sriramulu</b>.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Kurnool was the first capital of the Andhra State with High
                    Court at Guntur.

                </ul>

              <h3>Fazl Ali Commission</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  After the creation of Andhra State, demand for creation of
                  states on linguistic basis intensified and Fazl Ali Commission
                  was constituted in December, 1953,
                </li>
                <li>
                  It is also known as <b>States Reorganisation Commission</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It <b>accepted language as the basis of reorganisations</b> of
                  state but rejected the theory of ‘one-language-one state’.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The commission also suggested the abolition of the four-fold
                  classification of states and territories under the original
                  Constitution and creation of 16 states and 3 centrally
                  administered territories.
                </li>
                <li>
                  By the <b> States Reorganisation Act (1956)</b> and the 7th
                  Constitutional Amendment Act (1956), the distinction between
                  Part A and Part B states was done away with and Part C states
                  were abolished. Some of them were merged with adjacent states
                  and some other were designated as union territories. As a
                  result, 14 states and 6 union territories were created on
                  November 1, 1956.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Changes made by States Reorganization Act (1956)</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  New state of Kerala was established by merging the Travancore
                  - Cochin State with the Malabar District of Madras state and
                  Kasaragod of South Canara (Dakshina Kannada).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Telugu-speaking areas of Hyderabad state are merged with the
                  Andhra state to create the Andhra Pradesh state.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Madya Bharat state, Vindya Pradesh state and Bhopal state were
                  merged into the Madya Pradesh state.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Similarly, it merged the Saurashtra state and Kutch state into
                  that of the Bombay state, the Coorg state into that of Mysore
                  state; the Patiala and East Punjab States Union (Pepsu) into
                  that of Punjab state; and the Ajmer state into that of
                  Rajasthan state.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Moreover, it created the new union territory of Laccadive,
                  Minicoy and Amindivi Islands from the territory detached from
                  the Madras state.
