              <h2>Loss of Citizenship</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <p>
                According to the <b>Citizenship Act, 1955</b>, the citizenship
                can be lost in following three ways:
              </p>
              <h3>By Renunciation</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  If any citizen of India of full age and capacity can make a
                  declaration renouncing his Indian citizenship. Upon the
                  registration of that declaration, that person ceases to be a
                  citizen of India.
                </li>
                <li>
                  However, if such a declaration is made during a war in which
                  India is engaged, its registration shall be withheld by the
                  Central Government.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>By Termination</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  When an Indian citizen voluntarily acquires the citizenship of
                  another country, his Indian citizenship automatically
                  terminates.
                </li>
                <li>
                  This provision, however, does not apply during a war in which
                  India is engaged.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>By Deprivation</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Central government can terminate a person's Indian
                  citizenship, if:

                <ul style="list-style-type: square">
                  <li>the citizen has obtained the citizenship by fraud.</li>
