                state, but the Seventh Amendment Act of 1956 authorized the
                Parliament to establish a common high court for two or more
                states or for two or more states and a union territory. The
                Parliament can extend the jurisdiction of a high court to any
                union territory or exclude the jurisdiction of a high court from
                any union territory.
              </p>
              <p>
                Every high court (whether exclusive or common) consists of a
                chief justice and such other judges as the president may from
                time to time deem necessary to appoint. Thus, the Constitution
                does not specify the strength of a high court and leaves it to
                the discretion of the president. Moreover
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The President can appoint a judge of a high court as an
                  <b>acting chief justice</b> of the high court when the office
                  of chief justice of the high court is vacant or absent or the
                  the chief justice of the high court is unable to perform the
                  duties of his office.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The President can appoint duly qualified persons as
                  <b>additional judges</b> of a high court for a temporary
                  period not exceeding two years when there is a temporary
                  increase in the business of the high court.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The President can also appoint a duly qualified person as an
                  <b>acting judge</b> of a high court when a judge of that high
                  court (other than the chief justice) is unable to perform the
                  duties of his office due to absence or appointed to act
                  temporarily as chief justice of that high court or any other
                  reason.
                </li>
                <li>
                  At any time, the chief justice of a high court of a state can
                  request a <b>retired judge</b> of that high court or any other
                  high court to act as a judge of the high court of that state
                  for a temporary period.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Appointment of Judges</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The judges of a high court are appointed by the President.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The chief justice is appointed by the President after
                  consultation with the chief justice of India and the governor
                  of the state concerned.
                </li>
                <li>
                  For appointment of other judges, the chief justice of the
                  concerned high court is also consulted.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In case of a common high court for two or more states, the
                  governors of all the states concerned are consulted by the
                  president.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Qualification, Oath and Salary</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <h3>Qualifications of Judges</h3>
              <p>
                A person to be appointed as a judge of a high court, should have
                the following qualifications:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>He should be a citizen of India.</li>
                <li>He should satisy one of the following conditions:</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    He should have held a judicial office in the territory of
                    India for ten years or
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    He should have been an advocate of a high court (or high
                    courts in succession) for ten years.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </ol>
              <p>
                From the above, it is clear that the Constitution has not
                prescribed a minimum age for appointment as a judge of a high
                court but the maximum age is fixed at 62 years. The Constitution
                makes no provision for appointment of a distinguished jurist as
                a judge of a high court.
              </p>

              <h3>Oath or Affirmation</h3>
              <p>
                A person appointed as a judge of a high court, before entering
                upon his office, has to make and subscribe an oath or
                affirmation before the governor of the state or some person
                appointed by him for this purpose. In his oath, a judge of a
                high court swears:
              </p>
              <p>
                "... will bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of
                India as by law established, that I will uphold the sovereignty
                and integrity of India, that I will duly and faithfully and to
                the best of my ability, knowledge and judgement perform the
                duties of my office without fear or favour, affection or
                ill-will and that I will uphold the Constitution and the laws."
              </p>

              <h2>Tenure, Removal and Transfer</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <h3>Tenure</h3>
              <p>
                The Constitution has not fixed the tenure of a judge of a high
                court. However, it makes the following four provisions in this
                regard:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  He holds office until he attains the age of 62 years. Any
                  question regarding his age is to be decided by the president
                  after consultation with the chief justice of India and the
                  decision of the president is final.
                </li>
                <li>He can resign his office by writing to the president.</li>
                <li>
                  He can be removed from his office by the President on the
                  recommendation of the Parliament.
                </li>
                <li>
                  He vacates his office when he is appointed as a judge of the
                  Supreme Court or when he is transferred to another high court.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <h3>Removal of Judges</h3>
              <p>
                President can remove a judge of a High Court on proved
                <b>misbehaviour</b> or <b> incapacity</b> when parliament
                approves with a special majority of each House of Parliament
                (i.e., a majority of the total membership of that House and a
                majority of not less than two-thirds of the members of that
                House present and voting).
              </p>
              <p>
                The Judges Enquiry Act (1968) regulates the procedure relating
                to the removal of a judge of a high court by the process of
                impeachment:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  A removal motion signed by 100 members (in the case of Lok
                  Sabha) or 50 members (in the case of Rajya Sabha) is to be
                  given to the Speaker/Chairman.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Speaker/Chairman may admit the motion or refuse to admit
                  it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If it is admitted, then the Speaker/ Chairman is to constitute
                  a three-member committee to investigate into the charges.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The committee should consist of (a) the chief justice or a
                  judge of the Supreme Court, (b) a chief justice of a high
                  court, and (c) a distinguished jurist.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If the committee finds the judge to be guilty of misbehavior
                  or suffering from an incapacity, the House can take up the
                  consideration of the motion.
                </li>
                <li>
                  After the motion is passed by each House of Parliament by
                  special majority, an address is presented to the president for
                  removal of the judge.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Finally, the president passes an order removing the judge.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                From the above, it is clear that the procedure for the
                impeachment of a judge of a high court is the same as that for a
                judge of the Supreme Court. No judge of a high court has been
                impeached so far.
              </p>
              <h3>Transfer of Judges</h3>
              <p>
                The President can transfer a judge from one high court to
                another after consulting the Chief Justice of India. In the
                Third Judges case (1998), the Supreme Court opined that in case
                of the transfer of high court judges, the Chief Justice of India
                should consult, in addition to the collegium of four senior most
                judges of the Supreme Court, the chief justice of the two high
                courts (one from which the judge is being transferred and the
                other receiving him).
              </p>

              <h2>Independence of High Court</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Mode of Appointment</b>: The judges of a high court are
                  appointed by the president in consultation with the members of
                  the judiciary itself.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b> Security of Tenure: </b> The judges of a high court are
                  provided with the security of tenure. They can be removed from
                  office by the president only in the manner and on the grounds
                  mentioned in the Constitution. This means that they do not
                  hold their office during the pleasure of the president, though
                  they are appointed by him.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b> Fixed Service Conditions: </b> The salaries, allowances,
                  privileges, leave and pension of the judges of a high court
                  are determined from time to time by the Parliament. But they
                  cannot be changed to their disadvantage after their
                  appointment except during a financial emergency.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b> Expenses Charged on Consolidated Fund: </b> The salaries
                  and allowances of the judges, the salaries, allowances and
                  pensions of the staff as well as the administrative expenses
                  of a high court are charged on the consolidated fund of the
                  state. Thus, they are non-votable by the state legislature. It
                  should be noted here that the pension of a high court judge is
                  charged on the Consolidated Fund of India and not the state.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Conduct of Judges cannot be Discussed:</b> The Constitution
                  prohibits any discussion in Parliament or in a state
                  legislature with respect to the conduct of the judges of a
                  high court in the discharge of their duties, except when an
                  impeachment motion is under consideration of the Parliament.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Ban on Practice after Retirement:</b> The retired permanent
                  judges of a high court are prohibited from pleading or acting
                  in any court or before any authority in India except the
                  Supreme Court and the other high courts. This "ensures" that
                  they do not favor anyone in the hope of future favor.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Power to Punish for its Contempt:</b> A high court can
                  punish any person for its contempt. Thus, its actions and
                  decisions cannot be criticized and opposed by anybody. This
                  power is vested in a high court to maintain its authority,
                  dignity and honor.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b> Freedom to Appoint its Staff: </b> The chief justice of a
                  high court can appoint officers and servants of the high court
                  without any interference from the executive. He can also
                  prescribe their conditions of service.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b> Its Jurisdiction cannot be Curtailed: </b> The
                  jurisdiction and powers of a high court in so far as they are
                  specified in the Constitution cannot be curtailed both by the
                  Parliament and the state legislature. But, in other respects,
                  the jurisdiction and powers of a high court can be changed
                  both by the parliament and the state legislature
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Separation from Executive (Article 50): </b> The
                  Constitution directs the state to take steps to separate the
                  judiciary from the executive in public services. This means
                  that the executive authorities should not possess the judicial
                  powers.

              <h2>Jurisdiction and powers of High Court</h2>
              <div class="underline"></div>
              <h3>Original Jurisdiction</h3>
              <p>
                It means the power of a high court to hear disputes in the first
                instance, not by way of appeal. It extends to the following:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Matters of admiralty (cases concerning ships or the sea) and
                  contempt of court.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Disputes relating to the election of members of Parliament and
                  state legislatures.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Regarding revenue matter or an act ordered or done in revenue
                  collection.
                </li>
                <li>Enforcement of fundamental rights of citizens.</li>
                <li>
                  Cases ordered to be transferred from a subordinate court
                  involving the interpretation of the Constitution to its own
                  file.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The four high courts (i.e., Calcutta, Bombay, Madras and Delhi
                  High Courts) have original civil jurisdiction in cases of
                  higher value
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Writ Jurisdiction</h3>
              <p>
                Article 226 of the Constitution empowers a high court to issue
                writs including habeas corpus, mandamus, certiorari, prohibition
                and quo warranto for the enforcement of the fundamental rights
                of the citizens and for any other purpose. The phrase ‘for any
                other purpose’ refers to the enforcement of an ordinary legal
                right.
              </p>
              <p>
                The writ jurisdiction of the high court (under Article 226) is
                not exclusive but concurrent with the writ jurisdiction of the
                Supreme Court (under Article 32). It means, when the fundamental
                rights of a citizen are violated, the aggrieved party has the
                option of moving either the high court or the Supreme Court
                directly.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, the writ jurisdiction of the high court is wider than
                that of the Supreme Court. This is because, the Supreme Court
                can issue writs only for the enforcement of fundamental rights
                and not for any other purpose, that is, it does not extend to a
                case where the breach of an ordinary legal right is alleged.
              </p>
              <h3>Appellate Jurisdiction</h3>
              <p>
                A high court is primarily a court of appeal. It hears appeals
                against the judgements of subordinate courts functioning in its
                territorial jurisdiction.
              </p>
              <h3>Supervisory Jurisdiction</h3>
              <p>
                A high court has the power of superintendence over all
                subordinate courts and tribunals functioning in its territorial
                jurisdiction (except military courts or tribunals).
              </p>
              <h3>A Court of Record</h3>
              <p>As a court of record, a high court has two powers:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  The judgements, proceedings and acts of the high courts are
                  recorded for perpetual memory and testimony. These records are
                  admitted to be of evidentiary value and cannot be questioned
                  when produced before any subordinate court. They are
                  recognized as legal precedents and legal references.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It has power to punish for contempt of court, either with
                  simple imprisonment or with fine or with both.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <h3>Power of Judicial Review</h3>
              <p>
                Judicial review is the power of a high court to examine the
                constitutionality of legislative enactments and executive orders
                of both the Central and state governments. On examination, if
                they are found to be violative of the Constitution or
                ultra-vires (latin for "beyond the powers"), they can be
                declared as illegal, unconstitutional and invalid (null and
                void) by the high court. Consequently, they cannot be enforced
                by the government.
              </p>
              <p>
                Though the phrase ‘judicial review’ has nowhere been used in the
                Constitution, the provisions of Articles 13 and 226 explicitly
                confer the power of judicial review on a high court.
              </p>
              <p>
                The constitutional validity of a legislative enactment or an
                executive order can be challenged in a high court on the
                following three grounds:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>it infringes the fundamental rights (Part III)</li>
                <li>
                  it is outside the competence of the authority which has framed
                  it, and
                </li>
                <li>it is repugnant to the constitutional provisions.</li>
              </ol>
